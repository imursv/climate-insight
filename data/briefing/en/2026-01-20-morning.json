        "title": "🌍 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Socioeconomic Impacts 🔴",
        "content": "Several studies released today warn that climate change is having severe socioeconomic impacts worldwide. Specifically, the damage from heat inequality due to climate change has been measured in Rio de Janeiro's favela areas [34, 45], and an analysis also indicates that the economic cost of climate change nearly doubles when marine damage is considered [43]. Furthermore, new research findings suggesting that climate change is reducing Americans' real wages by approximately 12% are noteworthy [44]. From an ecosystem perspective, powerful cyclones induced by global warming can cause ecological changes [49], and extensive biological impacts are being observed, including an increased likelihood of extreme wildfires [51], changes in penguin breeding seasons [54], impacts on insects [58], and warnings about the global spread of seaweed blooms in the tropical Atlantic and Western Pacific [62].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ International Resistance to Climate Action and Policy Challenges ⚠️",
        "content": "Internationally, resistance to climate action and policy challenges are intensifying. In the UK, opposition to climate action in newspaper editorials has for the first time surpassed supportive opinions [37], reaching record levels of opposition in 2025 [59]. In the US, greenhouse gas emissions increased even before Donald Trump's policies took effect [38], and research has also shown that the majority of Americans misjudge which personal decisions contribute most to climate change [42]. These trends raise concerns that Trump's climate policy reversals, while not stopping global warming, could hinder international cooperation [55].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Challenges and Progress in Domestic Renewable Energy Transition ⚠️🌱",
        "content": "Domestic companies are facing significant difficulties in procuring renewable energy. Korean companies find it 3.5 times more challenging to procure renewable energy than their US counterparts [16], and the Federation of Korean Industries has requested policy support from the government, stating that 70 domestic companies are struggling [19, 25]. Nevertheless, various local governments and companies in Korea are continuing their efforts to expand renewable energy. Yongin Special City is increasing local energy self-sufficiency by directly producing and reinvesting in renewable energy [18], and has secured 1.9 billion KRW for solar power projects through its selection in the 'Climate-Safe Shade' public contest [21]. Furthermore, Yeoju City achieved the remarkable feat of being selected for the New and Renewable Energy Convergence Support Project for the sixth consecutive year in 2026 [24, 29, 30], and Topsolar signed an agreement with Hyundai E&C for the nation's largest 1.5 GW renewable energy supply [20, 31]. Various renewable energy projects are actively underway, including the promotion of 1.4 GW solar power generation within industrial complexes [33], KOSPO's on-site solar power management [17], the return of profits from village solar power generation in Hampyeong-gun [27], and Haezoom's completion of a 2.4 MW on-site PPA solar power plant [32].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expanding Domestic and International Efforts for Climate Change Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality 🌱",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts to address climate change and achieve carbon neutrality are expanding in various directions. Gangneung City is accelerating the creation of parks and green healing spaces to respond to climate change [4, 5], and LS Cable & System has achieved an A- rating in the CDP Climate Change Response assessment, joining the leadership group [6, 7, 8]. Chungnam Province and Yeongdong County are promoting the on-site dissemination of agricultural technologies for climate crisis response and smart farming pilot projects [9, 10], while Jinju City is supporting hydrogen electric vehicles, and Yecheon County is investing 22.5 billion KRW to leap forward as a carbon-neutral leading city [11, 12, 13], among other local government efforts for carbon neutrality. Internationally, discussions are underway on how to 'properly' utilize IPCC reports [1], adaptation mechanisms of animals to cope with climate change are being studied [35], and Google has announced that AI can play a key role in mitigating the impacts of climate change [41]. Additionally, the Biden-Harris administration is strengthening proposals to reduce methane pollution [61], and Scotland has announced its 2026-2040 Climate Change Plan [53], demonstrating active policy responses. Notably, Greenland's value is increasing due to global warming, highlighting the importance of Arctic security [3, 52, 60].",

    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we examined the severity of the global climate crisis, along with various domestic and international efforts to address climate change and the challenges encountered in that process. We hope that global cooperation and innovative domestic and international initiatives to tackle the climate crisis will continue to expand. This concludes today's climate briefing."
