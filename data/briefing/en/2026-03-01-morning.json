      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Policies and Carbon Neutrality Challenges",
        "content": "Domestically, Incheon City is demonstrating exemplary efforts by accelerating carbon neutrality practices in the public sector [3], while Haenam County and Haenam Office of Education are jointly declaring a future vision for AI and renewable energy, attempting to strengthen the local community's climate response capabilities [6]. However, at the national level, despite the confirmation of 'three key agendas' for amending the Carbon Neutrality Act, an agreement on the pace of greenhouse gas reduction failed, leaving a sense of regret [4]. The National Assembly's Special Committee on Climate Change's Public Deliberation Committee also failed to agree on a greenhouse gas reduction pathway, indicating that significant challenges remain in advancing domestic climate policies [5]. This situation underscores the need for strong leadership and social consensus to achieve domestic carbon neutrality goals.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Climate Crisis and Impacts on Cultural Heritage, Ecosystems",
        "content": "Globally, the impacts of climate change are widespread, affecting everything from cultural heritage to ecosystems and our daily lives. The situation where Michelangelo's masterpieces are forced to undergo restoration or repair due to climate change presents new challenges for cultural heritage preservation [8, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26]. Furthermore, new predictions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicate that climate change is rapidly shifting cultivation zones, potentially making the climate of the Midwest similar to that of Texas by 2050 [21]. This is reshaping the global coffee cultivation map and contributing to rising morning coffee prices [22]. In Australia, extreme weather events such as record heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and floods are causing immense loss and suffering to wildlife, ecosystems, and local communities, warning that the climate crisis is no longer a distant future problem [27].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Efforts for Climate Change Adaptation and Solutions",
        "content": "Diverse efforts to respond to the climate crisis are also continuing. HWPL is seeking to resolve complex crises by holding seminars on climate change and human rights crises, in addition to the issue of 'nuclear legacy' [1]. Domestically, the Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water) is strengthening specific adaptation efforts, such as hosting a 'Green Algae New Technology Forum' to advance its green algae response system amidst climate change [2]. Notably, the case where a small Caribbean island successfully sued the Netherlands over climate change can be regarded as a significant advancement in the international movement for climate justice and accountability [7]. These movements are positive signals, raising awareness of the climate crisis and seeking practical solutions.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Perception Gaps and Risk Warnings",
        "content": "Arguments are being made to update the list of climate change risks to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emphasizing the importance of global risk assessment [9]. However, a study in Connecticut (CT) reported a disconnect in public perception of climate change, suggesting the need for improved public awareness for effective climate action [10]. Meanwhile, warnings that localized weather phenomena like blizzards are not signs of climate change reversal [11, 13], along with the spotlight on the impact of the Alaskan Arctic in Omaha [15], remind us that climate change is having complex effects on global systems beyond regional boundaries. This once again highlights the importance of accurate understanding of climate science and realistic responses.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has clearly demonstrated the severe impacts of climate change on our society and nature, along with various domestic and international efforts to address them, and the challenges that still remain. This is a time that calls for sustained attention and responsible action. This concludes the climate briefing for February 28, 2026."
