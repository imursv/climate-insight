        "title": "⚠️ The Realistic Threats and Global Impacts of Climate Change",
        "content": "The threat of climate change is becoming a global reality, with its impacts manifesting across our daily lives and natural ecosystems. Domestically, a decrease in mackerel catches due to changes in sea temperature and a reduction in supply from Norway have led to mackerel becoming scarce [1]. Internationally, European ski resorts are facing threats from climate change and are being pushed to their limits [26], while in Argentina, climate change predictions related to critical temperatures and environmental issues for 2026 have been released [28]. Furthermore, in California, USA, climate change is accelerating the cost-of-living crisis, exacerbating difficulties for vulnerable populations [29], and research linking aging water systems and climate change to amoeba threats highlights our infrastructure's vulnerability [32]. This reality strongly suggests that ignoring climate change is no longer a viable solution [33], and we must recognize its severe impacts across our society, much like how children's lives are quietly being reshaped in India [37].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Transition and Expanding Eco-friendly Infrastructure",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea is undertaking diverse efforts to transition towards a carbon-neutral society. Phase 1 of the climate-resilient urban forest has been completed in Eongtto Park, Seogwipo City, enhancing the city's climate resilience [2], and Seongbuk-gu has been designated as a basic environmental education center, preparing to leap forward as a leading carbon-neutral city [5]. Notably, the management of the largest-ever climate response fund has been transferred to the Ministry of Climate, which will strongly support the implementation of carbon neutrality [4, 8]. The Korea National Railway Authority is encouraging citizen participation by inviting ideas for achieving carbon neutrality through the 'Green Rail Challenge' [6, 7], and voluntary efforts from the industry continue, with Hyosung Chemical embarking on process improvements to achieve net-zero [9]. Additionally, the government plans to accelerate the transition to eco-friendly mobility by supplying electric and hydrogen vehicles for 50% of new cars by 2030, and by providing more subsidies for electric motorcycles that can travel long distances on a single charge [23].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Renewable Energy Expansion Policies: Achievements and Points for Consideration",
        "content": "Domestic renewable energy deployment shows positive results and concrete movements towards expansion. In 2024, the installed capacity of new and renewable energy exceeded 41GW, with solar power accounting for a high proportion of 77.2% [19]. Chungcheongnam-do is actively promoting pilot projects for renewable energy installation by utilizing public idle land and collaborating with Samsung Display [11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21], while Gunsan City has declared itself the 'Renewable Energy Capital of Korea' and is dedicating all efforts to administration that citizens can experience firsthand [12, 18]. While the government is exploring a future 'energy mix' emphasizing the harmony between renewable energy and nuclear power [10], there are also warnings that Korea's solar power industry has a high dependency on China, which could pose a potential economic threat [22]. These warnings re-emphasize the importance of supply chain stabilization and technological independence in expanding renewable energy.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response Efforts and Political Challenges",
        "content": "The international community continues its diverse efforts to address climate change, but simultaneously faces various challenges. Abu Dhabi is accelerating carbon-neutral urban development, increasing solar and nuclear power generation, and preparing for a post-oil era [3]. Three municipalities in Long Island, USA, have received climate change-related grants from the State DEC, strengthening their local-level responses [27], and the Governor of Hawaii also announced new commitments in 2026 to address housing, healthcare, and climate change issues [35]. Just as research suggests that common daisies have become a 'visible sign' of climate change [31], nature continuously sends us messages of change. However, concerns have also been raised that global ambitions for climate change action could be weakened by certain political leadership [34], further highlighting the importance of international cooperation.",
        "tone": "mixed"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the severe impacts of climate change, alongside various domestic and international efforts to overcome them, and the challenges that lie ahead for the future. Through sustained attention and action, we must strive to build a better future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
