    "opening": "Good morning/afternoon. I will now begin the climate briefing for January 10, 2026.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Response Policies and Energy Transition Discussions",
        "content": "Domestically, policy efforts to overcome the climate crisis are ongoing, and expectations are building for strengthened climate action at the local council level. An example of this is the election of Seoul City Council member Lee Hyo-won as Vice Chairman of the Special Committee for Overcoming the Climate Crisis of the National Council of Metropolitan and Provincial Council Chairpersons [1]. Concurrently, discussions have arisen suggesting that it is time to actively consider self-generation solutions utilizing renewable energy and SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) to meet the surging power demands of AI data centers [2]. This indicates a critical challenge for achieving both domestic industrial development and climate goals simultaneously.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Direct Impacts of Climate Change and Global Warnings",
        "content": "Globally, the direct impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly prominent. Climate change is reshaping the form of winter [6], and reports even indicate that people are experiencing more pain in connection with weather changes [4]. Notably, in Quebec, Canada, an unusual natural phenomenon occurred where Lake Rouge disappeared overnight, traveling approximately 10 km to flow into a larger lake, raising questions about whether this is due to human activity [11]. Furthermore, a warning has been issued that climate change is negatively affecting chocolate production, suggesting that our chocolate cravings may soon come at a cost [9]. These reports clearly demonstrate the widespread and severe impacts of climate change on our daily lives and environment.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Carbon Inequality and International Responsibility",
        "content": "A shocking report has emerged indicating that the issue of carbon emission inequality in climate crisis response has reached a severe level. According to Oxfam research, the wealthiest 1% globally had already exhausted their fair annual carbon emission allowance within just 10 days of the start of 2026, and the wealthiest 0.1% did so in just 3 days [10]. This strongly suggests that the climate crisis is deeply intertwined with issues of inequality. Meanwhile, concerns have also been raised regarding the impact of the United States' withdrawal from international organizations on climate change and biodiversity, once again emphasizing the importance of global cooperation [5].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Seeking Climate Solutions through Technological Innovation and Funding",
        "content": "The importance of technological innovation and funding to resolve the climate crisis is also being highlighted. Bill Gates, while funding various green energy technologies, emphasized that 'something more' is needed for true climate action to succeed [3]. He also stated that funding is urgently needed in the areas of climate change and children's health, and that artificial intelligence (AI) can help, raising expectations for the positive role of technology [7]. Concurrently, biochar has been presented as an effective method that can contribute to climate change mitigation and realize carbon market potential, adding hope for new solutions [8].",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has conveyed a complex message encompassing the severe impacts and inequalities of climate change, as well as domestic and international policy efforts and technological innovations to address them. This is a time that calls for sustained attention and action. This concludes the climate briefing for January 10, 2026."
