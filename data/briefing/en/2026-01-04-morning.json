      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Action and Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Following the official name change of the National Climate Crisis Response Committee, measures for expanding renewable energy through cooperation with local governments were discussed [1, 2]. The Committee announced the integrated public call for the 'Net Zero ChallengeX' in 2026 and is encouraging active climate action by hosting a carbon neutrality implementation performance sharing session and the 'Net Zero Friends Season 3' awards ceremony [3, 6, 7]. At the regional level, Seoul's Seongbuk District has been designated as a basic environmental education center, emerging as a leading carbon-neutral city, while South Chungcheong Province is actively promoting pilot projects for renewable energy installation [5, 8]. Notably, Gunsan City in North Jeolla Province has declared 2026 as the inaugural year for its leap to become the 'Renewable Energy Capital of Korea,' dedicating full efforts to citizen-centric administration, and Incheon City Gas has also announced a major transition to new and renewable energy [9, 10, 11]. Prime Minister Kim Min-seok visited a community-participatory solar power generation site in the Sinan region, expressing national interest in the renewable energy transition [12].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Efforts to Address the Climate Crisis",
        "content": "Internationally, positive movements to address climate change are being observed. Abu Dhabi is accelerating carbon-neutral city development, increasing solar and nuclear power generation [4]. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in the U.S. provided climate change-related grants to three Long Island municipalities, supporting local climate action [20]. Hawaii's Governor also announced new commitments for 2026 to address climate change, alongside housing and healthcare issues, expressing a strong will for a sustainable future [27]. These examples demonstrate that concrete and practical efforts to overcome the climate crisis are continuing in various parts of the world.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Global Climate Change Impacts and Warning Messages",
        "content": "Currently, severe impacts and warning messages about climate change are continuously emerging worldwide. The Boston Globe reported on research suggesting that current cold weather may be linked to climate change, and a smog season in the Lahore region is highlighting the reality of climate change [13, 14]. Climate change is affecting Cuesta College students, and predictions regarding Argentina's critical temperatures and environmental issues are being made [17, 18]. Particularly in California, there are reports that climate change is exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, putting low-income populations in extremely difficult situations [23], and impacts on crop evolution and agriculture in the Upper Midwest of the U.S. are also being observed [22]. Despite 'terrible climate change' being observed over the past 20 years, stern warnings continue that innovation alone cannot escape the climate crisis, and ignoring climate change will not make the problem disappear [16, 24, 25]. Furthermore, analyses linking climate change to 'remnants of empire' and 'climate colonialism' suggest a complex background to the issue [26].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 In-depth Understanding and Discourse on Climate Change",
        "content": "Various discourses are also continuing to foster a deeper understanding of the complexity and reality of climate change. In-depth explorations are being conducted into what virtual worlds can teach us about the reality of climate change [15, 19], reflecting considerations for new ways to convey climate change messages. Furthermore, Millennium Post is addressing the topic of 'The Science of Climate Change,' contributing to increasing public understanding of the scientific basis and mechanisms of climate change phenomena [28]. These discussions play a crucial role in spreading multifaceted approaches and awareness regarding climate change.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the coexistence of multifaceted domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis, alongside warning messages about its severe impacts. This is a time that calls for sustained attention and action on climate change. This concludes today's climate briefing."
