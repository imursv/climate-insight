        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis Warnings and Historical Lessons",
        "content": "Modeling results after COP 30 indicate that the world has significantly deviated from the path to achieving climate goals, once again underscoring the severity of the climate crisis [10]. Recently in Chile, wildfires caused by extreme heat resulted in tragic casualties, with 21 deaths and dozens evacuated [13]. Domestically, 84% of North Chungcheong Province residents perceive climate change as serious, and 88% anticipate it will worsen in the future, revealing a high level of crisis awareness [2]. Furthermore, a claim has emerged that the collapse of the Tang Dynasty was caused not by rebellion but by 'climate change,' sounding an alarm about the historical impact of climate on civilizations [1].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Climate Change Denialism and Its Impact",
        "content": "As the U.S. braces for record-breaking cold, former President Donald Trump sparked controversy by questioning the existence of global warming [11, 12]. In response, scientists firmly stated that global warming is 'right here,' and social media platforms also imposed sanctions on former President Trump's climate change claims, expressing vigilance against factual distortions [11, 12]. However, news that climate change signs were removed from U.S. national parks warns of the risk of repeated attempts to erase history, which could undermine social consensus on climate crisis response [14].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Carbon Neutrality Practices and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Various local governments across the country are continuing concrete efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Jecheon hosted a 'Carbon Neutrality and Corporate Response Strategies' workshop to support businesses in their sustainable transition [3]. Seongbuk-gu is promoting a 'Zero Disposable Cup Campaign' to encourage small daily practices among citizens for carbon neutrality [4]. Furthermore, Wando-gun is investing 4.1 billion KRW to expand eco-friendly mobility, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions in the local community through proactive investment [5].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Change Research and Solution Seeking",
        "content": "In the international community, in-depth research and the search for solutions to climate change are actively underway. Scientific questions are being raised about whether climate change weakens the polar vortex, exploring the complexity of the climate system [6]. Meanwhile, a UM professor discussed the link between climate change and mental health, highlighting the multifaceted impacts of the climate crisis on human lives [9]. Institutions like the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions are seeking sustainable solutions [7], and the 2025 Experiential Learning Symposium will feature student presentations, including those on climate change preparedness [8]. Furthermore, news that Chinese electric vehicles like BYD could enter B.C. as part of the expansion of eco-friendly mobility is noteworthy as part of international carbon reduction efforts [13].",

    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis, along with various domestic and international efforts to address it. This is a critical time that urgently requires continued attention and cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
