        "title": "🔴 The Frontline of the Climate Crisis: Surging Wildfires and Food Insecurity",
        "content": "The global increase in wildfire risk due to climate change is sounding a serious alarm. Over the past 45 years, 'wildfire-prone days' have increased approximately threefold both domestically and internationally [3, 8, 140, 142, 146], with the expansion of hot and dry weather conditions identified as the primary cause. Experts, including Professor Min Seung-ki's team at POSTECH, point out that carbon neutrality efforts alone are insufficient to significantly reduce the risk of large-scale wildfires [18, 29, 30, 37, 41, 51, 82, 88], emphasizing the need for more proactive response strategies, including atmospheric carbon reduction. Concurrently, climate change is directly impacting our food supply, with the possibility of rising coffee prices due to heatwaves hindering coffee crop growth [1, 143], and the importance of the aquaculture industry being highlighted due to declining Yellow Croaker catches [4, 17]. In the Philippines, agricultural damage has reached 219 billion dollars [139], demonstrating the increasing global economic costs caused by climate change [131].",

        "title": "🌱 Diverse Domestic and International Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Diverse domestic and international efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are underway to address the climate crisis. Microsoft has reaffirmed its commitment to carbon neutrality by fully powering its data centers with renewable energy by 2030 [32, 104]. Domestically, various local governments are pursuing concrete policies such as hosting forums to create carbon-neutral urban environments [27, 48, 65, 66, 69], expanding the supply of eco-friendly vehicles [36, 75], and reducing waste [33]. Notably, Gimhae City and Dongjak-gu are providing incentives and mileage points to citizens practicing carbon neutrality [34, 35, 38, 44, 46, 50, 55, 57, 58, 60, 74, 79, 81], encouraging the spread of an eco-friendly culture in daily life. In the education sector, efforts to strengthen the climate capabilities of future generations are active, including carbon-neutral ecological education at the National Jangseong Forest Training Center [49, 54, 62, 80] and mandatory climate action for Jeju students [45, 63]. The Korea Forest Service has declared a grand journey towards carbon neutrality by initiating a 'nationwide tree-planting campaign' in Jeju [61], and Busan City is fostering an ESG center as a key hub [53, 67, 71, 72, 73, 83, 85]. Various stakeholders are actively contributing to the transition to a carbon-neutral society.",

        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition: The Era of Energy Independence",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy is emerging as a key driver for building energy-independent cities. Boseong County is actively pursuing an 'energy-independent city' based on renewable energy [12, 95, 96, 97, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 111, 116, 117, 121], and is even exploring income generation for residents through the introduction of a 'sunlight pension' scheme [103, 108]. Domestic and international companies are also actively investing in renewable energy. The Adani Group plans to invest 100 billion dollars in renewable energy-based AI data centers [113, 125], and LS Electric is building solar-linked energy management solutions [122], demonstrating market growth alongside technological advancements [99, 126]. Notably, the sharp drop in battery storage costs is further accelerating the spread of renewable energy [98]. The Daebul Industrial Complex in Yeongam County has initiated the nation's first direct power transaction, supplying renewable energy directly to resident companies [118, 124], showcasing the realization of energy independence. While an amendment to the 'Renewable Energy Act' has passed the National Assembly, paving the way for expanded renewable energy supply [107], concerns about reverse discrimination due to guaranteed privileges for renewable energy have also been raised in some regions [102].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Climate Change Adaptation and Policy Strengthening: Local Community Responses",
        "content": "Local communities are intensifying their adaptation efforts to respond to the direct impacts of climate change. Jeju Province is proactively responding to changes in marine ecosystems by investing 29.6 billion KRW in 33 eco-friendly aquaculture projects to address climate change [2, 15, 21, 23, 25]. Furthermore, an amendment to the 'Climate Change Monitoring and Prediction Act' has passed the National Assembly plenary session [13], establishing a legal foundation for climate change monitoring and prediction systems. Adaptation measures at the infrastructure management and urban planning levels are also gaining attention, such as the importance of road management during thawing periods [5] and urban protection strategies through Low Impact Development (LID) [11]. Jinju City is accelerating its green initiatives to combat the climate crisis [77, 87, 89, 90, 91], actively implementing climate response policies tailored to daily life. In this way, domestic local governments are contributing to enhancing the climate resilience of their communities through active climate actions, including efforts to host the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties [7] and achieving the highest ratings in global climate agreements [14].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response: Challenges and Solidarity",
        "content": "The international community is demonstrating various challenges and solidarity alongside the spread of awareness about climate change. In the United States, environmental groups are filing lawsuits against the repeal of key EPA climate change regulations [129, 132, 147], and some states are suing the Trump administration to secure funding for clean energy projects [148], indicating ongoing legal battles surrounding climate action. Facing the climate crisis, the African continent is seeking response strategies amidst international solidarity and competition [16, 26], while China is demonstrating the evolution of its climate change politics [134]. Meanwhile, efforts to raise public awareness through cultural and artistic fields continue, such as climate change and animal protection messages being conveyed at the Olympic closing ceremony [19], and the dissemination of climate change awareness through quilt making [133]. The threats posed by climate change across ecosystems, including extreme weather phenomena, declining river biodiversity [135], a double blow to Arctic seals [136], and the endangered status of California's wild native fish [137], remain serious challenges.",
