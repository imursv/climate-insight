      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Threats and Impacts of Climate Change",
        "content": "Today's climate news reports numerous direct threats from deepening climate change, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, various species are losing their habitats due to reckless development and climate change [1], and the future of the Winter Olympics is threatened by a lack of snow and unstable venues [3, 134]. In particular, news that radish and cabbage cultivation in Gangwon Province's alpine regions is facing difficulties and requires 11.5 billion won in support demonstrates the direct impact of climate change on domestic agriculture [18]. Internationally, warnings about the impact of climate change on Great Lakes fish populations in the 2030s [115, 122], changes in the reproductive cycle of Mediterranean gorgonian corals [124], and research indicating that suitable areas for raising cattle, sheep, and goats could be halved by 2100 pose a serious warning for food security [120, 121, 141, 145]. Furthermore, an analysis suggesting that the climate crisis acts as a 'time bomb' for national credit ratings, expanding risks associated with fossil fuels and weather disasters, amplifies concerns about its economic repercussions [16].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Climate Policy Setbacks and Political Challenges",
        "content": "Political movements that run counter to climate change response efforts have also been observed. News has emerged that U.S. judicial agencies have removed 'climate change guidelines' at the request of the Republican Party [4]. Moreover, former President Trump is pushing to abolish the basis for greenhouse gas regulations, which is being assessed as a 'major retreat in climate policy' and is expected to be announced this week [20, 21, 23, 26, 114]. These moves signal a major shift in U.S. climate policy, and environmental groups have announced lawsuits in response [23]. Meanwhile, a Southern Oregon senator is reintroducing a bill to charge large oil companies for climate change-related disaster costs [126], and in Illinois, proposals are emerging to impose financial responsibility for climate change on corporations [127], indicating active discussions on accountability for the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expanding Domestic and International Carbon Neutrality and Climate Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Amidst these threats, diverse efforts are continuing both domestically and internationally to respond to climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. Cheongsong County is promoting smart apple cultivation in response to climate change, transitioning to future-oriented farming methods [2, 8, 9, 12], and Wando County has established its 3rd climate crisis adaptation plan covering coastal and fisheries sectors [11]. The government is seeking carbon-neutral solutions from the land, accelerating the development of biochar and carbon mineralization technologies [13], and Incheon City is pursuing carbon credit acquisition through 'blue carbon' projects utilizing tidal flats and marine ecosystems [17, 19, 22, 29, 56]. Furthermore, Dongdaemun District has launched a 'Carbon Neutral One Team' with 10 local organizations to spread daily practices [32, 33, 41, 53, 54], and Haenam County has announced plans to create a national hub for carbon neutrality education [45, 52]. Internationally, nitrogen has been found to play a crucial role in tropical forest restoration and climate change mitigation [136], and Hakodate is recognized as a resilient city in the face of climate change and disasters [140].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Expansion and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "There is also much positive news in the renewable energy sector, which is central to climate change response. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has established a 'Renewable Energy Weather Information Platform' that provides wind and solar radiation data using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support site selection and expand supply [59, 61, 67, 71, 72, 76, 78, 85, 93, 101, 102, 104, 105]. The government and renewable energy purchasing companies are working together to achieve the 100GW renewable energy target [65, 66, 73, 90], with the Minister of Climate particularly emphasizing strengthening renewable energy competitiveness [91, 98]. Domestic companies are collaborating with global investors to pursue North American solar and ESS projects [63, 81, 84, 99], and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) is expanding its renewable energy footprint from dam-top solar to pumped-hydro storage [82]. Wanju County is building a 'Sunshine Pension Village' model that returns renewable energy profits to residents, contributing to local income generation [80, 87, 96, 103, 106, 108], and Gwangju City is also creating a virtuous cycle by generating revenue through the sale of solar certificates and reinvesting it into the local community [62, 88, 89, 92, 95, 107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]. Internationally, the expansion of renewable energy is accelerating, with global wind and solar power generation plans for 2025 reaching new highs [149].",

    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the severe reality of climate change while simultaneously showcasing the diverse domestic and international efforts underway to overcome it. We must continue to foster a more sustainable future through sustained interest and cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
