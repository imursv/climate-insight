        "title": "🔴 U.S. EPA's Reversal of Climate Policy and Deepening International Concerns",
        "content": "Today, major foreign news outlets reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revoke its previous finding that 'greenhouse gases are harmful,' with an announcement expected as early as this week [1, 5, 54, 58, 59, 67]. This move could undermine the foundation of U.S. climate change policy and lead to a halt in greenhouse gas regulations, raising concerns within the international community [74, 99]. Notably, some U.S. officials, including Mayor Easton, oppose this policy reversal, emphasizing that climate change is a reality [73, 80]. Scientists warn that the Earth is closer than previously thought to a tipping point towards an irreversible 'hothouse Earth,' pointing to a lack of political will to address climate change [82, 95].",

        "title": "⚠️ Global Climate Crisis Impacts: Warnings Across Disasters, Ecosystems, and Society",
        "content": "Globally, the impacts of climate change are intensifying. Recent devastating wildfires that swept through Argentina and Chile demonstrate a threefold increase in the likelihood of 'fire weather' due to climate change, threatening the oldest trees [63, 64, 68, 70, 75, 77, 86, 91, 100]. Domestically, there have been warnings about the potential collapse of Hallasan's Baengnokdam crater lake due to the climate crisis [4]. Climate change is also having widespread effects, including shifts in plant habitats [55], deepening the plastic pollution crisis [56], threatening the winter sports industry [57, 76, 81], and exacerbating the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis [78]. Furthermore, climate change is pushing certain species towards extinction and causing ecosystem disruptions such as a decline in the birth rate of southern right whales [69, 94, 96], and is spreading into socio-psychological issues, intensifying anxiety among young people suffering from depression [92].",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Republic of Korea Accelerates Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Various local governments and public institutions across South Korea are actively pursuing carbon neutrality and responding to climate change. Daegu City has secured the highest GCoM rating for two consecutive years, proving its leadership as a carbon-neutral city [10, 13, 14, 15, 29, 30]. In Seosan, Chungnam Province, a Carbon Neutrality Demonstration Support Center, funded with 48.5 billion KRW, has opened, officially launching the industrialization of CCU (Carbon Capture, Utilization) [8, 11, 16, 17, 21, 24, 31, 32]. Furthermore, various region-specific policies are being implemented, including Suncheon City's blue carbon ecosystem creation [3], Cheongsong County's smart apple cultivation [2], Jincheon County's promotion of ESG policies [7], and Jeju Island's investment in carbon neutrality points [9, 22] [6, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In the energy transition sector, 88 public institutions have joined 'K-RE100,' setting a goal to significantly increase renewable energy usage from 14% to 60% within five years [36, 37, 39, 45, 46, 47, 49, 51]. The Ministry of Climate has also announced a 'two-track' strategy, simultaneously promoting renewable energy and nuclear power [41, 44]. However, concerns about the insufficient public discussion period for the Carbon Neutrality Act amendment [12] and safety issues with new and renewable energy due to wind turbine fires [43] remain challenges requiring continuous attention and improvement.",

      {
        "title": "🌍 Diverse Climate Change Response Efforts and Research Trends in the International Community",
        "content": "The international community continues to pursue diverse approaches and efforts to address climate change. Minnesota has unveiled its 2026 Climate Action Framework, which includes a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 [85], and a climate change education bill has advanced in Virginia [61]. One study analyzed climate change response policies in 40 countries, attempting to identify the most effective strategies [88]. Policy discussions are active, with proposals in Illinois to impose financial responsibility for climate change on corporations [87, 90]. Efforts to find scientific solutions are also ongoing, such as exploring the possibility of protecting coffee plants using biopolymers [60] and research on climate change inventory [62] [66]. A recent survey indicated that public concern about climate change remains high despite increasing fears of conflict, underscoring the need for continued international attention and cooperation [93].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "As discussed in today's briefing, while there are concerns regarding international policy setbacks and severe impacts of climate change, significant progress is also being made both domestically and internationally towards carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition. This concludes today's climate briefing."
