    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🌱 Strengthening Corporate Climate Change Response Capabilities",
        "content": "Today, the climate change response efforts of domestic companies garnered significant attention. HD Hyundai Construction Equipment and HD Hyundai Infracore demonstrated their ESG capabilities by securing the top 'A grade' in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change response assessment [1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 19]. Hankook Tire also continued its climate change response efforts by earning the highest 'A' rating for two consecutive years [10]. Furthermore, Hyundai Engineering received an award at the 'Artificial Ground Greening Awards,' demonstrating its eco-friendly landscaping capabilities for climate change response [9]. These achievements serve as important indicators of companies fulfilling their environmental responsibilities and pursuing sustainable management in an era of climate crisis [17, 18].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Diverse Efforts for Domestic Carbon Neutrality Realization",
        "content": "Proactive movements toward achieving carbon neutrality have been observed across various local governments and institutions in Korea [25, 28, 37]. Samcheok City received the Prime Minister's Commendation for its contributions to carbon neutrality, while Geochang County is leading '2050 Carbon Neutrality,' laying the foundation for a future-oriented eco-city and achieving the nation's highest ratings in carbon neutrality and waste management [26, 28, 40]. Gimhae City and Daejeon Yuseong-gu are making tangible progress in everyday carbon neutrality practices by selecting outstanding carbon neutrality action groups and holding performance report meetings [30, 38, 46, 49]. The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth stipulates strategies and obligations for achieving carbon neutrality, and policies are also being developed in the power sector to respond to the major energy transition [23, 31, 39].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Policy Support",
        "content": "Domestic policy efforts to accelerate the transition to renewable energy are continuing [50, 51]. Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) established a 'Renewable Energy Headquarters' in line with government policies, and the Korea Energy Agency (KEA) received a ministerial award in recognition of its achievements in promoting the use of renewable energy [52, 56]. Jeollanam-do plans to create 500 'Sunshine Income Villages' aimed at increasing residents' income and expanding renewable energy, and 13 'Energy Highways' are scheduled to be constructed by 2030 to cope with the rapid increase in renewable energy in the Honam region [51, 64, 66]. The energy transition centered on renewable energy is becoming more concrete, with Pohang City's designation as a specialized distributed energy zone and the consideration of a 'Green Tariff System' for consumers willing to pay higher rates for renewable electricity [29, 55, 60].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Realistic Threats of Climate Change and Policy Challenges",
        "content": "The threats posed by climate change are becoming a reality both domestically and internationally, and these are recognized as critical business risks [24, 69]. The domestic aquaculture industry is facing a crisis of collapse amidst the climate crisis [24], and internationally, Alaska's sacred Arctic Refuge is threatened by climate change and oil drilling activities [68]. Glacier shrinkage in the Austrian Alps is severely impacting tourism and wildlife [76, 78], and an analysis suggests that climate change has reshaped wild ecosystems throughout 2025 [71]. Furthermore, some countries are grappling with and changing their renewable energy policy directions, such as Japan's tightening regulations on solar power generation and the US's abandonment of offshore wind and focus on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) [53, 59].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Research and Food System Transformation for Climate Change Response",
        "content": "Globally, research is actively underway to respond to climate change and ensure food security [74, 77, 80]. According to research findings, the transformation of the global food system has been identified as a key factor in mitigating climate change and improving health [74]. Additionally, researchers worldwide are seeking scientific solutions, such as discovering genes that can secure food supplies in the face of climate change [77]. This research is expected to provide crucial insights for farmers in arid regions to decipher climate change and stabilize food supplies [80].",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, climate change presents a global challenge, but at the same time, various efforts are underway from corporations, governments, and the international community to overcome it. It is time to understand these complex trends of climate change and strengthen our actions for a sustainable future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
