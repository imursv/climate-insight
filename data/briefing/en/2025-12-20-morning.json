    "opening": "Good morning. Welcome to the climate briefing for December 19, 2025. Today, we aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of the globally intensifying climate threats and the response efforts by both international and domestic communities to address them.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Threats and Policy Retreat",
        "content": "Recently, the international community has seen reports of movements undermining climate change response and severe impacts. In the United States, it has been pointed out that 'MAGA' is ignoring climate change, thereby threatening the national economy [1]. The Trump administration's 'war on science' and plans to abolish key research institutions are expected to negatively impact discussions on climate change response [41, 62]. Furthermore, the U.S. non-participation in COP30 is amplifying concerns about the international community's collective response efforts [50]. Amidst these policy setbacks, climate change is exerting widespread socioeconomic impacts, including income reduction [33], increased home insurance premiums [35], accelerated warming of holidays [38], and accounting for the majority of U.S. Western wildfire emissions [39]. It is also having fatal impacts on biodiversity, with rare plants like the Philippine pitcher plant already facing crisis [45]. Concurrently, movements by some corporations, such as Toyota, to encourage lobbying for the relaxation of environmental regulations further underscore the urgency of responding to the climate crisis [61].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Action Efforts and Research Advancements",
        "content": "Amidst these threats, the international community continues diverse efforts to address climate change. U.S. Senate Democrats are advancing a resolution acknowledging climate change, expressing their policy commitment [34, 40], and at COP30, the International Climate Democracy Alliance has launched, seeking to strengthen global governance [43]. Laboratories at the University of Arizona are utilizing innovative data approaches in biodiversity and climate change research [44], and interesting solutions, such as research into plants that could save chocolate production from climate change, are also being explored [46]. Furthermore, innovative technologies, such as research findings that concrete used in buildings plays a role in combating climate change [53], are gaining attention, and a U.S. state government is providing $11 million for climate change response projects, including those in South Jersey, thereby enhancing community resilience [52]. With Thai and British scientists collaborating to build resilience in the seaweed industry [58], scientific research and practical efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change are actively continuing worldwide.",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating the Implementation of Domestic Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea is making multifaceted efforts and showing positive progress towards achieving its carbon neutrality goals. Recently, an amendment to the Carbon Neutrality Act passed the Special Committee on Climate Crisis, which is expected to concretize support for damages to climate-vulnerable groups [5]. This marks a significant advancement in climate policy that considers social equity. Furthermore, a support center for eco-friendly future car parts conversion has broken ground, establishing a foundation for leading carbon neutrality [6, 15]. The nation is also accelerating the transition to a hydrogen economy through discussions on a fuel cell roadmap and the hosting of conferences utilizing clean hydrogen [12, 13]. Various entities are proactively responding to climate change, with the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) and Haenam-gun each winning grand prizes in the climate change response sector [2, 3], and Cheonan-si beginning to diversify rice varieties to address climate change [4]. Several local governments, including Goheung-gun, Yecheon-gun, and Seogwipo-si, are providing incentives through the Carbon Neutrality Point System, encouraging citizens to participate in carbon reduction efforts [7, 8, 9, 10, 14].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of domestic renewable energy and strengthening of policies",
        "content": "Domestically, the policy foundation for expanding renewable energy deployment is being strengthened, and practical business initiatives are actively underway. The Korea Federation of Renewable Energy Organizations (KFREO) has taken on an important role in representing the voice of the renewable energy industry by registering as the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment's first incorporated association [16, 17, 18, 20]. Furthermore, cooperation among various entities is increasing, exemplified by the Korea Energy Agency and the Catholic Committee for Ecological Environment signing an MOU for expanded renewable energy deployment [19]. The government is intensifying comprehensive support for the solar power sector to achieve its goal of 100 GW of renewable energy by 2030 [22], and next year, 7 GW of solar power generation capacity is expected to be supplied to the RE100 market [23]. Gochang County, as the first local government to do so, held a resident-participatory policy direction forum on agricultural solar power, making efforts to increase public acceptance [24, 31]. Concurrently, the Gyeongsangnam-do Provincial Council is pursuing the enactment of ordinances for renewable energy installation in public parking lots and idle sites [27, 29, 30]. These initiatives demonstrate that institutional foundations for renewable energy expansion are also being established at the local level. Furthermore, Korea's top three battery manufacturers are actively shifting their business focus from electric vehicle batteries to Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and adopting LFP batteries as a new growth engine [28]. These movements within the industry are accelerating the energy transition.",

    "closing": "Through today's briefing, we have strived to provide an in-depth understanding of climate threats and opportunities. Climate change is a global challenge, and only through the continuous attention and participation of governments, industries, and civil society alike can we ensure a sustainable environment for future generations. This concludes today's climate briefing."
