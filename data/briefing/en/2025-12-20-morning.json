    "opening": "Good morning/afternoon. Welcome to the climate briefing for December 19, 2025. Today, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the escalating global climate threats and the corresponding response efforts from both the international and domestic communities.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Threats and Policy Reversals",
        "content": "Recently, the international community has reported movements that run counter to climate change response efforts and severe impacts. In the United States, there have been criticisms that 'MAGA' is ignoring climate change, thereby threatening the national economy [1]. The Trump administration's 'war on science' and plans to abolish key research institutions are expected to negatively impact discussions on climate change response [41, 62]. Furthermore, the U.S. absence from COP30 has amplified concerns about the international community's collective response efforts [50]. Amidst these policy reversals, climate change is exerting widespread socioeconomic impacts, including reduced income [33], increased home insurance premiums [35], accelerated warming of holidays [38], and accounting for the majority of wildfire emissions in the Western U.S. [39]. It is also having fatal effects on biodiversity, with rare plants like the Philippine pitcher plant already facing crisis [45]. Concurrently, actions by some corporations, such as Toyota, encouraging lobbying efforts to ease environmental regulations further underscore the urgency of addressing the climate crisis [61].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response Efforts and Research Advancements",
        "content": "Despite these threats, the international community continues its diverse efforts to address climate change. U.S. Senate Democrats are expressing their policy commitment by pushing for a resolution acknowledging climate change [34, 40]. At COP30, the International Climate Democracy Alliance was launched to explore strengthening global governance [43]. University of Arizona labs are utilizing innovative data approaches in biodiversity and climate change research [44], and intriguing solutions, such as research into plants that could save chocolate production from climate change, are also being explored [46]. Furthermore, innovative technologies are gaining attention, including research indicating that concrete used in buildings plays a role in combating climate change [53]. One U.S. state government is supporting climate change response projects, including those in South Jersey, with $11 million, enhancing community resilience [52]. Scientific research and practical efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change are actively continuing worldwide, such as the collaboration between Thai and British scientists to build resilience in the seaweed industry [58].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Implementation",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea is making multifaceted efforts and showing positive progress towards achieving its carbon neutrality goals. A recent amendment to the Carbon Neutrality Act has passed the Special Committee on Climate Crisis, which will concretize support for climate-vulnerable groups [5]. This marks a significant advancement in climate policy that considers social equity. Furthermore, the Eco-friendly Future Car Parts Conversion Support Center has broken ground, laying the foundation for carbon neutrality leadership [6, 15]. Discussions on a fuel cell roadmap utilizing clean hydrogen and the hosting of conferences are also accelerating the transition to a hydrogen economy [12, 13]. Various entities are proactively responding to climate change, with the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) and Haenam-gun each receiving grand prizes in climate change response [2, 3], and Cheonan City beginning to diversify rice varieties to address climate change [4]. Several local governments, including Goheung-gun, Yecheon-gun, and Seogwipo-si, are providing carbon neutrality point incentives to encourage citizens' participation in carbon reduction practices [7, 8, 9, 10, 14].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expanding Domestic Renewable Energy and Strengthening Policies",
        "content": "Domestically, the policy foundation for expanding renewable energy supply is being strengthened, and practical project implementation is actively underway. The Korea Renewable Energy Federation has registered as the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment's first incorporated association, taking on a crucial role in representing the voice of the renewable energy industry [16, 17, 18, 20]. Collaboration among various entities is increasing, as evidenced by the signing of an MOU between the Korea Energy Agency and the Catholic Ecological Environment Committee to expand renewable energy supply [19]. The government is fully commencing comprehensive support for the solar power sector to achieve its goal of 100 GW of renewable energy by 2030 [22], and next year, 7 GW of solar power generation is expected to be supplied to the RE100 market [23]. Gochang-gun is making efforts to enhance public acceptance by hosting the first resident-participatory policy direction forum for agri-photovoltaics among local governments [24, 31]. The Gyeongsangnam-do Provincial Council is also establishing institutional foundations for renewable energy expansion at the local level, such as pursuing the enactment of ordinances for installing new and renewable energy facilities in public parking lots and idle sites [27, 29, 30]. Furthermore, the 'K-battery Big 3' are actively moving to accelerate energy transition, shifting their business focus from electric vehicle batteries to energy storage systems (ESS) and adopting LFP batteries as a new growth engine [28].",
        "tone": "positive"

    ],
    "closing": "Through today's briefing, we have strived to provide a deeper understanding of climate threats and opportunities. Climate change is a global challenge, and only the sustained attention and participation of governments, industries, and civil society can ensure a sustainable environment for future generations. This concludes today's climate briefing."
