      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Crisis Intensification and Extreme Weather Phenomena",
        "content": "2025 is expected to be recorded as a year of severe anomalous climate phenomena globally. In South America, extreme heatwaves persisted, with heat warnings issued even in December [5], and globally, the world is 'reeling' from anomalous weather events such as heatwaves and torrential rains [6]. In particular, alarm bells are ringing regarding the accelerated climate change in the Arctic, which is expected to be included in the 2025 NOAA report [3]. The European continent is being reshaped by climate change [33, 46], and ecosystems are being reorganized at an unprecedented pace, with rising water levels and increased flood risks in West Virginia [30, 41]. Australia also experienced fires and floods throughout 2025, and residents in the Roebourne region of Western Australia are suffering from heatwaves reaching 50C [50, 51].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Increased Human Vulnerability Due to Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change is directly threatening human lives and communities worldwide. Fiji is already being forced to relocate villages due to climate change [36], and Tuvaluans are migrating to Australia through the world's first climate change visa program as their homes are submerged [39]. These phenomena demonstrate that climate change is no longer a distant future problem, but an ongoing issue of forced migration and survival. Furthermore, in California, climate change is accelerating the cost-of-living crisis, pushing the impoverished into even more difficult situations, thus acting as a factor that exacerbates socioeconomic inequality [38].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Adaptation and Challenges in the Agricultural Sector",
        "content": "Domestically, climate change is directly impacting the agricultural sector, leading to new challenges and ongoing adaptation efforts. Jeju's tangerine industry is facing a double challenge from climate change and tariff-free mandarin imports [1], and in response, farmers are seeking change, such as transitioning to cultivating late-ripening citrus fruits as a new high-income crop [2]. In Cheongdo, Gyeongbuk Province, a major forum on agricultural countermeasures for climate crisis response was held to discuss strategies for the sustainability of local agriculture [4]. These efforts highlight the realistic challenges faced by domestic agriculture in the era of climate change and emphasize the need for proactive adaptation strategies.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Carbon Neutrality Implementation Efforts and Energy Transition",
        "content": "Various local governments and industries across the country are making multifaceted efforts to transition to a carbon-neutral society. The Ministry of Climate has clarified reduction targets by finalizing the emissions of companies participating in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme until 2030 [7]. Gimhae City is making substantial social contributions, such as supporting vulnerable groups in responding to cold waves with profits from its carbon-neutral sharing market [8, 20], while Anseong City and Sinan County have opened carbon neutrality support centers, embarking on full-scale policy implementation and establishing dedicated hubs [10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Furthermore, Gwangju Metropolitan City has proven its status as a leading carbon-neutral city through a white paper [19], and efforts for industrial transformation are also active, with calls for Pohang City to emerge as a global carbon-neutral steel innovation city [12]. However, challenges also exist in the energy transition process, such as the offshore wind industrial complex development project in Goseong, Gyeongnam Province, becoming uncertain due to controversy surrounding the sale of SK Oceanplant [28].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Policy and Skeptical Perspectives",
        "content": "Internationally, alongside policy efforts to address climate change, some political rhetoric and skepticism persist. By the end of 2025, Colorado, USA, officially failed to meet its first major greenhouse gas target, revealing difficulties in policy implementation [44]. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump claimed climate change was a 'hoax' and spread misinformation regarding clean energy, leading to a trend of reduced climate-related reporting [34, 43, 52]. Such political claims suggest that they could act as significant obstacles to international cooperation and domestic policy implementation for addressing the climate crisis.",

    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, the climate crisis is intensifying globally, demanding immediate and multifaceted responses. This concludes today's climate briefing."
