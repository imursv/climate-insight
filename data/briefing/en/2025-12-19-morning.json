    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Policies and Legislative Trends",
        "content": "In the National Assembly, the 'Clean Thermal Energy Act' has been proposed for the clean transition of thermal energy [1, 4, 5], signifying important progress towards achieving carbon neutrality goals [5]. Additionally, the 'Carbon Neutrality Act Amendment,' which stipulates the protection of climate crisis vulnerable groups as a fundamental national principle, has passed the Special Committee on Climate Change [7, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33], establishing a basis for national support for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and outdoor workers [18, 24]. Concurrently, the Ministry of Climate is promoting the expansion of tax credits for renewable energy investments [48], and Representative Park Hae-cheol has proposed legislation to expand public renewable energy [50], thereby strengthening the legislative foundation for domestic climate policies. Jeju Island has been designated as a specialized zone for distributed energy and is set to be utilized as a demonstration testbed for 2035 carbon neutrality [10].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are gaining momentum. A 1,200-ton 'Ocean Lab' has been established in Jeju to research the impact of climate change on ecosystems [2], and in Haenam-gun, the Agri-Food Climate Change Response Center and the Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center are scheduled to break ground next year [6]. Yongin Special City is holding 'On-site Carbon Neutrality Business Support Briefings' for small and medium-sized enterprises [8, 34], and Jeonju City is providing carbon neutrality point incentives to approximately 10,000 people [15, 31], demonstrating active participation from local governments and civil society. Notably, the Korea Renewable Energy Foundation has launched a pilot project for renewable heat energy certification and trading [35], and VPP Lab and POSCO International have signed an MOU for new renewable energy business development [37], indicating an acceleration of the private sector's transition to renewable energy. As a result of these efforts, renewable energy generation has ranked first, and positive phenomena such as the shrinking of the ozone hole have also been observed [38, 46].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Intensification of the Climate Crisis and Challenges of Response",
        "content": "Both domestically and globally, various response challenges are emerging as the climate crisis intensifies. Amidst the climate crisis, blind spots exist regarding the protection of eco-friendly farms [3], while carbon-intensive steel and petrochemical industries are taking a 'direct hit' in the transition to carbon neutrality [30]. In the process of renewable energy expansion, it has been found that 3 out of 5 citizens recognize the seriousness of false information [39], leading to the launch of fact-checking platforms like 'Re:Fact' [40, 44]. Furthermore, controversy and backlash over 'corporate favoritism' surrounding the inclusion of air-source heat pumps into renewable energy are escalating [42, 49], and claims of 'threats to survival rights' by farmers' organizations regarding the enactment of the 'Renewable Energy Special Act' have also been raised [59]. Internationally, British scientists have unveiled a worst-case climate crisis scenario involving 'large-scale disruption' [74, 96], and warnings have also emerged that we are already surpassing dangerous global warming tipping points [76]. Climate change is manifesting as various social issues, including legal lawsuits in Japan [71], escalating farmer-pastoralist conflicts in Senegal [79], and impacts on mental and physical health [87, 92].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Enhancing Climate Adaptation and Awareness within the International Community",
        "content": "The international community continues its efforts to respond to and adapt to the complex impacts of climate change. The Governor of the Bank of France emphasized the importance of the financial sector, referring to climate change as part of the 'core mandate of price stability' [67], while Microsoft signed its first renewable energy PPA in Europe, expanding cooperation in AI and the power sector [47]. In New York, a plan to plant 25 million trees was presented as part of climate change response efforts [73], and Mayor Kawakami signed the Kauai Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, initiating specific local-level responses [85]. Additionally, a teacher in Zimbabwe is helping to build climate change capacity for the deaf community [91], highlighting the importance of education and support to enhance the climate resilience of vulnerable groups and communities [93]. Research has been published indicating that the global food system is causing a dual crisis of obesity and global warming [95], but there is also analysis suggesting that solutions, such as improving ultra-processed food diets, are within reach [70].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing addressed domestic and international policy advancements and practical efforts to tackle the climate crisis, alongside the complex challenges that still confront us. We hope this information serves as a catalyst for a deeper understanding of climate change and prompts further action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
