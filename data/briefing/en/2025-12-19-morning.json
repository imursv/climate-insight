      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Policy and Legislative Trends",
        "content": "In the National Assembly, the 'Clean Thermal Energy Act' has been proposed for the clean transition of thermal energy [1, 4, 5], marking significant progress towards achieving carbon neutrality goals [5]. Furthermore, an amendment to the 'Carbon Neutrality Act,' which stipulates the protection of climate-vulnerable groups as a fundamental national principle, has passed the Special Committee on Climate Change [7, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33]. This establishes a basis for national support for vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and outdoor workers [18, 24]. Concurrently, the Ministry of Climate is pushing for an expansion of the renewable energy investment tax credit rate [48], and Representative Park Hae-cheol has proposed legislation to expand public renewable energy [50], thereby strengthening the legislative foundation for domestic climate policies. Jeju Island has been designated as a distributed energy specialized zone and will be utilized as a demonstration testbed for 2035 carbon neutrality [10].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are expanding. A 1,200-ton 'ocean laboratory' is being established in Jeju to study the impact of climate change on ecosystems [2], and in Haenam County, the Agri-Food Climate Change Response Center and a Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center are scheduled to break ground next year [6]. Yongin Special City is holding 'On-site Carbon Neutrality Business Support Briefings' for small and medium-sized enterprises [8, 34], and Jeonju City is providing carbon neutrality point incentives to over 10,000 people [15, 31], demonstrating active participation from local governments and civil society. Notably, the Corporate Renewable Energy Foundation has launched a pilot project for renewable thermal energy certification and trading [35], and VPP Lab and POSCO International have signed an MOU for new renewable energy business development [37], accelerating the private sector's transition to renewable energy. As a result of these efforts, renewable energy generation has reached the top rank, and positive phenomena such as the shrinking of the ozone hole have also been observed [38, 46].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Climate Crisis and Response Challenges",
        "content": "Domestically and internationally, various response challenges are emerging alongside the deepening climate crisis. There are blind spots in protecting eco-friendly farms amidst the climate crisis [3], and carbon-intensive industries like steel and petrochemicals are taking a 'direct hit' in the transition to carbon neutrality [30]. In the process of renewable energy expansion, it has been found that three out of five citizens are aware of the seriousness of misinformation [39], leading to the launch of fact-checking platforms like 'Re:Fact' [40, 44]. Furthermore, controversy and opposition regarding 'corporate favoritism' surrounding the inclusion of air-source heat pumps in renewable energy are escalating [42, 49], and farmers' organizations have raised claims of 'threats to their right to survival' concerning the enactment of the 'Special Act on Renewable Energy' [59]. Internationally, British scientists have unveiled worst-case climate crisis scenarios involving 'widespread chaos' [74, 96], and warnings have emerged that we have already surpassed dangerous global warming tipping points [76]. Climate change is manifesting as various social issues, including legal disputes in Japan [71], escalating farmer-herder conflicts in Senegal [79], and impacts on mental and physical health [87, 92].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Adaptation and Awareness Raising",
        "content": "The international community continues its efforts to respond to and adapt to the complex impacts of climate change. The Governor of the Bank of France emphasized the importance of the financial sector by referring to climate change as part of the 'core responsibility for price stability' [67], and Microsoft signed its first renewable energy PPA in Europe, expanding cooperation in AI and power sectors [47]. In New York, a plan to plant 25 million trees was presented as part of climate change response [73], and Mayor Kawakami signed the Kauai Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, initiating concrete local-level responses [85]. Furthermore, a teacher in Zimbabwe is helping to build climate change capacity within the deaf community [91], highlighting the importance of education and support for enhancing the climate resilience of vulnerable groups and communities [93]. While research has been published indicating that the global food system is causing a dual crisis of obesity and global warming [95], there is also analysis suggesting that solutions through improving ultra-processed food diets are within reach [70].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted domestic and international policy advancements and practical efforts to address the climate crisis, as well as the complex challenges we continue to face. We hope this information serves as an opportunity to foster a deeper understanding of climate change and prompt action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
