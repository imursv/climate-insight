        "title": "🔴 International Climate Policy Retreat and Urgent Warnings",
        "content": "Today, concerning news regarding climate change response has emerged from the international community. As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to revoke its finding that 'climate change endangers the public,' health and environmental groups have challenged this and filed lawsuits [32, 34, 71, 75, 76]. Warnings followed that this could lead to worsening health and increased household costs in the U.S. [41, 42]. Furthermore, the U.S. energy chief has called on the International Energy Agency (IEA) to 'abandon' its focus on climate change, raising concerns that this could exacerbate confusion in the international community's climate response efforts [43, 57, 64, 66]. In addition to these attempts at policy retreat, hot and dry days conducive to wildfires have nearly tripled globally over the past 45 years [56, 74], and major coffee-growing regions are reportedly suffering from harmful high temperatures for several more weeks due to climate change [38, 52]. The European Union's (EU) top advisory body urged the initiation of plans to prepare for catastrophic global warming, emphasizing the severity of the situation [61].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Domestically, local communities continue their active efforts to respond to climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. Ulsan City is strengthening support by investing 8.3 billion won to enhance the competitiveness of pear farmers in response to climate change [1, 5, 6, 7]. Pyeongtaek City is ambitiously pursuing carbon neutrality policies [10, 12], and Siheung City has launched a citizen-participatory carbon neutrality practice app, 'Carbon Household Account Book Plus,' to encourage daily carbon reduction [11, 17]. Furthermore, Gwangmyeong City has signed a social contribution agreement for renewable energy with NH Nonghyup Bank and is expanding community participation by supporting climate-vulnerable households with carbon neutrality practice points donated by citizens [16, 23, 27]. Notably, Yeongam County has become the first in the nation to be approved for an on-site PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) method to directly supply renewable energy to the Daebul Industrial Complex, presenting a new model for renewable energy dissemination [21, 25, 26, 28]. In addition, various entities are actively working towards achieving carbon neutrality goals, including Yangcheon-gu's fostering of a green generation [9], S-OIL's eco-friendly activities and carbon neutrality point accumulation [13], Busan City's opening of the 'Our Neighborhood ESG Center' [15], Changwon City's recruitment of participants for the Carbon Neutrality Point System (automotive sector) [18], Nowon-gu's 'honor student' evaluation for global climate crisis response [19], and Seongdong-gu's project to replace high-efficiency eco-friendly boilers in gosiwons (mini-studios) [31].",

        "title": "📰 Climate Industry and Technological Innovation and Challenges",
        "content": "Research has revealed that the climate crisis response industry has created 110,000 jobs over the past decade, emerging as a new engine for economic growth [3]. Global corporations are also actively engaged. The Adani Group has announced plans to invest $100 billion in renewable energy-powered AI data centers by 2035 [29], and Microsoft has stated it will continue to purchase renewable energy to meet all its power demands [78]. However, while big tech companies claim that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will help solve climate change, some environmental groups criticize this as 'greenwashing,' suggesting the need for discussion on the true environmental contribution of technology [54]. Meanwhile, in the medical sector, major medical supplies such as disposable blood pressure cuffs, nitrile gloves, N95 filtering face masks, CT scanners, and surgical gowns have been identified as carbon emission sources, necessitating efforts to reduce emissions [40, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Domestically, Pohang City demonstrated its commitment to participating in international climate discussions by holding promotional briefings to host the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC COP) [8].",

      {
        "title": "⚠️ Global Climate Threats and Increased Vulnerability",
        "content": "Globally, the threats of climate change and the resulting increase in vulnerability are reaching critical levels. Analysis indicates that up to half of the world's rangelands could exceed their existing ecological limits due to climate change, and the African continent faces a severe climate crisis, standing at a crossroads between solidarity and competition [2, 4]. Specifically, research has revealed that Arctic seals are being doubly impacted by climate change and persistent pollutants [45], and warnings have emerged that California's wild native fish could face near-certain extinction in the absence of federal climate action [51]. Furthermore, extreme weather events, including severe cold spells alongside global warming, continue to occur [58], and the survival of snowy owls is also threatened by climate change and human impact [67]. In Europe, the threat of the Chikungunya virus is increasing due to climate change, raising concerns about deepening public health issues [68]. Amidst these global threats, a new climate finance initiative has been launched to support climate adaptation efforts in glacier-dependent regions [60], and the UN is pushing to translate the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) advisory opinion on climate change obligations into concrete action [63].",

    ],
    "closing": "As you have seen in today's briefing, climate change is a global challenge that is simultaneously creating new opportunities. Amidst policy uncertainties in the international community, various domestic and international actors are striving for carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition, which are crucial steps towards a sustainable future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
