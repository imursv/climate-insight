      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening Domestic Climate Change Response Capabilities and Expanding Cooperation",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea is actively strengthening its domestic capabilities to address climate change and expanding public-private cooperation. Yeosu City has been confirmed as the host city for the 2026 UN Climate Change Conference Climate Week, enhancing its international standing [1]. Suwon City Council inspected waste transfer stations, climate change experience centers, and carbon-neutral green city project sites, reinforcing its commitment to local climate policies [2, 6]. Furthermore, Namseoul University and Cheonan City have trained a total of 162 carbon-neutral experts, focusing on human resource development [3, 5]. Sejong City Council member Hong Na-young emphasized that the public sector must play a leading role in achieving carbon neutrality and responding to the climate crisis [4]. The Daegu Regional Environmental Office and the Nakdong River Regional Environmental Office each signed business agreements with various organizations in the Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Busan-Ulsan-Gyeongnam (BUK) regions to respond to the climate crisis and promote renewable energy, establishing regional cooperation systems [7, 9, 10, 11].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Socio-economic Impacts",
        "content": "Globally, the impacts of the climate crisis are deepening, sounding widespread alarms across all socio-economic sectors. In the UK, flood risks are being reshaped by the climate crisis, leading to growing concerns about homeownership [12], and the importance of research into its impacts on forest and water resource management is also being highlighted [13]. Despite global warming, extreme winter weather, such as snowstorms in the US and heatwaves in Australia, could deepen misunderstandings about climate [17, 20], and questions have been raised about whether phenomena like Storm Chandra could lead to frequent flooding in small rivers, posing new risks [21]. These changes are leading to increased home insurance premiums and consumer dissatisfaction in 2026 [19], outdoor workers in Kenya are suffering due to climate change [24], and the threat of global warming looms over the next Winter Olympics in Alpine cities [25].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Challenges in Climate Policy Direction and Public Perception",
        "content": "Important discussions are ongoing within the international community regarding policy directions for climate change response and public perception. Notably, concerns are growing about the status of climate issues in economic policy, as a Trump-nominated Federal Reserve chair candidate could potentially alter banks' climate change response strategies [14], or even disregard climate change altogether [15]. Meanwhile, a study analyzing Americans' beliefs and attitudes towards climate change is scheduled for Fall 2025 [16], drawing attention to the impact of public perception on policy decisions. Furthermore, a letter response to a draft climate change plan [23] suggests the importance of coordinating opinions among various stakeholders in the climate policy-making process of each country.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Innovation and Alternative Solutions for a Sustainable Future",
        "content": "In response to the climate crisis, efforts to explore innovative technologies and alternative solutions for a sustainable future are also actively underway. Domestically, GS E&C is expanding direct solar power transactions with LG Uplus, promoting the use of renewable energy [8]. Globally, the adoption of electric vehicles is rapidly increasing and becoming mainstream in both developed and developing countries, significantly contributing to the decarbonization of the transportation sector, as seen in the cases of Norway and Denmark [26]. Furthermore, there are active discussions on ways to reduce the environmental damage caused by the livestock industry due to human preference for meat, while still sustaining dietary habits [27], and the popular drama 'Grey's Anatomy' is contributing to raising public awareness by addressing climate change in five episodes [18].",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted various domestic and international efforts to address climate change, the impacts of the deepening climate crisis, and policy challenges. Solidarity within the international community and innovative approaches will become increasingly crucial for a sustainable future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
