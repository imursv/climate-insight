    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Acceleration of the Climate Crisis and Global Impacts",
        "content": "Experts are warning that the environmental crisis is progressing decades ahead of predictions [10]. Indeed, climate change is exacting a much greater toll on the oceans than anticipated [14], leading marine life such as sharks to seek habitat changes [23]. Guinea-Bissau is threatened by rising sea levels and climate change [15], and in Baldwin Beach Park in Paia, Hawaii, climate change directly caused the removal of 18 coconut trees [37]. The fate of the world's coastlines depends on how quickly the Antarctic ice sheet melts, with warnings that some parts of Antarctica hold enough ice to raise sea levels by 15 meters [52].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Climate Change Threatens the Future of Winter Sports",
        "content": "News continues to emerge daily that climate change is reshaping the future of the Winter Olympics, including reducing the number of potential host cities in Europe [11, 18]. These warnings are repeatedly reported by various media outlets worldwide, emphasizing the severe impact of climate change on winter sports [21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]. This is a clear signal that climate change is broadly affecting even our culture and leisure activities.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Local Governments and Corporations' Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy",
        "content": "Domestically, local governments are actively responding to climate change. Wonju City has completed its final report on urban climate change disaster vulnerability analysis [1], and Seoul City demonstrated leading efforts by achieving the highest rating in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)'s 2025 city climate crisis response assessment [2]. Furthermore, practical education for farmers on climate change response in Chuncheon City received a great response [3], and Incheon City hosted an event to discuss citizen action strategies and tasks for carbon neutrality [4]. In the corporate sector, KEPCO KPS has prioritized 'carbon neutrality' in its budget operations this year [5], and Chungcheongbuk-do Province signed a business agreement with organizations including the Geum River Basin Environmental Office to expand renewable energy and achieve electricity self-sufficiency [7], contributing to the achievement of national carbon neutrality goals.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Change Response Trends and Challenges",
        "content": "Internationally, various discussions and challenges regarding climate change are underway. News that Wall Street has turned its back on climate change prompts a reconsideration of the financial sector's role [9], and concerns that opportunities to dominate Uzbekistan's renewable energy market could shift to Japan are calling for stronger PPP support from the Korean government [8]. Meanwhile, UC Santa Cruz researchers are studying the link between coastal fog and climate change [16], and scientists have shown positive progress in revealing hidden terrains and secrets of climate change through mapping Antarctica's subsurface [19, 20]. Broader conversations about climate change and artificial intelligence [12], as well as the political framing of climate change as a 'left-wing agenda' [22], also illustrate the complex nature of the international community's response.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the acceleration of the climate crisis and its widespread impacts, alongside diverse response efforts both domestically and internationally. We are reminded once again that climate change is no longer a problem of the future but a present, ongoing reality. We emphasize the importance of sustained attention and action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
