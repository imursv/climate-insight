        "title": "🔴 Climate Crisis Warnings and Intensification of Extreme Weather Events",
        "content": "Today's domestic and international climate-related news reports warn that the global climate crisis is facing an irreversible situation, and that extreme weather events will intensify as a result [5]. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has forecasted that this year's temperatures will be higher than average, with a likelihood of recurring heatwaves, heavy rains, and droughts, and also anticipates a rise in sea surface temperatures [8, 28, 87]. Internationally, extreme weather phenomena caused by climate change are manifesting globally, including consecutive days of heatwaves exceeding 40℃ in Australia [14, 112], and severe winter storms and Arctic cold snaps expected to hit North America [89, 98, 103, 105, 108, 109, 110]. Such climate change has led to disasters like the Pakistan floods [25], and a Christian Aid report has warned that it will incur immense costs in 2025 [102].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Acceleration of Domestic Climate Change Response and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts are being advanced to address the climate crisis. In the agricultural sector, the operation of the 'Climate Change Research Building' for future climate reproduction using AI and research on extreme weather response are being fully initiated [2, 3, 7, 15, 17], alongside activities to assist with on-site diagnosis of crop diseases and pests [12]. Corporations are also actively engaging in climate change response; SK ecoplant, for instance, received a 'Leadership A-' rating in the CDP Climate Change Response assessment, acknowledging its global-standard climate action efforts [4, 6, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26]. Furthermore, policy and industrial support for eco-friendly mobility transition is active, with Gwangju City providing subsidies for eco-friendly hydrogen vehicle purchases [10], and Hyundai Motor and Kia strengthening low-interest benefits for electric vehicles [85]. Community-level climate change response projects, such as Cheongju City's creation of 'Urban Wind Path Forests,' are also noteworthy [16].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 In-depth Discussion on Carbon Neutrality Goals and Energy Transition Strategies",
        "content": "Discussions and implementation towards achieving the 2050 carbon neutrality goal are actively underway both domestically and internationally. LG Group has announced its 2050 carbon neutrality target [41], and eBay also aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 [50]. Local governments, including Jecheon City and Chungcheongbuk-do Province, are enhancing implementation capabilities by holding workshops on carbon-neutral corporate response strategies and reviewing 156 tasks [31, 46, 48]. Seongbuk-gu is promoting citizen participation by launching a 'Disposable Cup Zero' campaign [45, 49]. Notably, the Korean Nuclear Society has argued that additional new nuclear power plant construction is essential to meet the 2050 carbon neutrality target and increasing AI power demand, thereby sparking in-depth discussions on energy transition [32, 33, 34, 39, 44, 51, 53, 55, 59]. Meanwhile, the government is pushing to establish a system for stable supply and demand management in line with the expansion of renewable energy [61], and measures to expand renewable energy, such as amending laws for 'priority access' for village community renewable energy [57], are being explored [66, 69, 76]. However, there are also warnings regarding the recognition of renewable energy without clear standards [65, 79].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Society's Climate Change Impacts and Scientific Inquiry",
        "content": "In the international community, various impacts of climate change and scientific inquiry into them continue. While there was criticism that climate change discussions were sidelined at the Davos Forum [88], its effects on ecosystems are clearly observed, with climate change advancing the breeding season of Antarctic penguins [94, 99], and research suggesting that whales can cope with food shortages by dividing or sharing resources [92, 95, 101]. Greenland plays an immense role in climate change science research [93], and scientific efforts to understand the complexity of climate change are ongoing, such as McMaster and Hakai Institutes receiving $2.3 million for ancient DNA research related to climate change [113]. Meanwhile, the documentary 'The Lake,' produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and others, raised warnings about the devastating consequences if Utah's Great Salt Lake disappears [104, 115], once again reminding us that climate change is a real threat.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "The domestic and international climate trends we have examined in today's briefing highlight the urgency of the climate crisis, while also demonstrating that various efforts and discussions are underway to overcome it. We must respond wisely to the climate crisis through continued attention and cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
