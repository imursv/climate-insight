    "opening": "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. We will now begin the climate briefing for February 21, 2026.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Escalating Economic and Catastrophic Risks of Climate Change",
        "content": "Domestically today, the 'insurance underwriting avoidance phenomenon' due to climate change is intensifying, emphasizing the importance of public-private joint responses [1, 5]. Internationally, data has been released indicating that climate change is already impacting global coffee production, raising concerns about its economic ripple effects [17]. Furthermore, the complex impact of climate change on avalanche risks in the Sierra Nevada and Lake Tahoe regions is being analyzed [16, 20], suggesting that the catastrophic aspects of climate change are not confined to specific areas. Meanwhile, alongside a warning that 'no one can escape' [23], criticism has also been raised that some European countries are denying the reality of being submerged and ignoring the climate crisis [25, 28], highlighting significant differences in perception within the international community.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Expansion of Domestic Carbon Neutrality Practices and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, various practical efforts and adaptation measures to address climate change are being actively pursued. Climate change response efforts gained momentum with tree planting in February [2, 6], and Jangsu County is supporting orchard damage reduction facilities to mitigate agricultural losses due to climate change [3]. Furthermore, the 25th Gwangyang Plum Blossom Festival has transitioned to a sustainable model, highlighting the importance of climate change response even in local festivals [4]. Efforts by local governments and academia to create carbon-neutral urban environments continue, including lectures at Sehan University and Suseong-gu Office's 'Sumi Changjo Forum' [7, 8], as well as Cheonan City's strengthened public-private cooperation and holding of its general assembly [9, 10]. To promote carbon neutrality in daily life, senior sewing activist classes have begun at Cheongju City Senior Welfare Center [11], and Paju City continues to support reusable container programs for funeral homes [12], demonstrating comprehensive efforts across various sectors.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Current Challenges",
        "content": "Alongside domestic efforts for the transition to renewable energy, some immediate challenges have also emerged. Boseong County is actively pursuing an 'energy self-sufficient city' based on renewable energy, showing positive movement towards this transition [14], and technological innovations are steadily progressing, such as the gaining attention offshore hybrid power generation technology that simultaneously harnesses wind and wave power [15]. However, during this transition, the Namdong Power labor union vehemently opposed the establishment of a renewable energy corporation [13], once again highlighting the importance of social consensus and stakeholder persuasion in advancing renewable energy policies.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Complexity of International Community's Climate Change Perception and Response",
        "content": "The international community is exploring various approaches to address climate change while facing complex challenges. In Portlandia, activities to combat climate change are underway [18], and various clubs have called for unified efforts against climate change [19]. In academia, attempts to broaden the academic and cultural understanding of climate change continue, such as a colloquium exploring art history and climate change held at UC Davis [21]. However, political and social resistance and practical limitations also clearly exist, such as the removal of climate change-related signs in Acadia National Park, which triggered a lawsuit [22], and residential buildings in New York City struggling to meet decarbonization targets [24]. Analysis also suggests that climate change is behind disasters in the Himalayan region [27], demonstrating the increasing urgency for integrated global responses.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing covered the various risks posed by climate change and the response efforts both domestically and internationally, suggesting the need for integrated and practical efforts from the international community to address the climate crisis, which is expected to intensify further. This concludes the climate briefing for February 21, 2026."
