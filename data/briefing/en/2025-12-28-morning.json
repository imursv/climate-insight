      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Crisis Expansion and Immense Costs",
        "content": "Throughout 2025, numerous images capturing the destruction, sorrow, and resilience caused by the intensifying climate change have been recorded worldwide [12, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Notably, research has revealed that extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and storms have resulted in economic losses exceeding 120 billion dollars globally, further underscoring the severity of the situation [13]. Furthermore, warnings that global warming will accelerate if 2.7 billion people do not reduce their beef consumption indicate an urgent need for changes in human lifestyles [1, 2]. Beyond being merely an environmental issue, climate change is increasingly recognized as a human rights crisis, urging immediate action across all sectors, including the travel industry [21].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Regional Extreme Weather Phenomena and Ecosystem Threats",
        "content": "Domestically, the Gwangju and Jeonnam regions have faced unprecedented extreme weather phenomena, recording 426mm of torrential rainfall in a single day and 29.6 days of heatwaves [3]. Internationally, ski resorts across Europe are struggling with operations due to a lack of snow [9], and the impact on ecosystems is severe, with extreme weather events identified as a major cause of declining bird populations [10]. Along Spain's Costa Brava coast, fishermen are making desperate efforts to save rare corals from climate change [18, 20], once again highlighting the urgency of marine ecosystem conservation.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Hope Through Renewable Energy Expansion and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "Amidst grim forecasts, hopeful news continues to emerge. China is projected to establish a 'virtuous cycle' through its renewable energy support policies, gaining an advantage in eco-friendly fuel production [5]. Domestically, Representative Kim Sung-hwan has expressed a consistent commitment to promoting renewable energy development policies [6], and the Jeonnam region is emerging as an optimal location for AI and data centers due to its favorable renewable energy and power infrastructure [8]. Furthermore, companies like YM Tech are leading the EV relay market and rising as strong players in the new and renewable energy sector [7], and discussions are actively underway regarding whether artificial intelligence (AI) can combat global warming [19], demonstrating diverse efforts to address climate change through technological innovation.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 The Importance of Community Carbon Neutrality Practices and Behavioral Change",
        "content": "In Gwandong Village, Hwasan-myeon, domestic efforts towards carbon neutrality, described as 'starting from the fingertips,' are showing tangible changes, demonstrating the significant impact of voluntary community climate action [4]. Meanwhile, international research has revealed that the level of religiosity influences climate crisis actions [11], suggesting that socio-cultural factors and individual values play a crucial role in responding to climate change. This emphasizes that alongside technological solutions, changes in individual awareness and practical actions by citizens are key to overcoming the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted both the escalating reality of the global climate crisis and its immense costs, alongside hopeful response efforts through community initiatives and technological innovation. Continued attention and action are imperative. This concludes today's climate briefing."
