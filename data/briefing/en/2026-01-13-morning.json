        "title": "🔴 Extreme Weather Events Striking the World and Their Impacts",
        "content": "As of 2026, climate change is no longer a theoretical risk but a present reality [34]. Deadly floods in Indonesia are a complex result of climate change and deforestation [39], and in the UK, flood victims are appealing for help amidst fears of the next disaster [52]. In the United States, in addition to changes in daily life such as basement flooding, analyses have also emerged indicating that climate change has already negatively impacted Americans' incomes [37, 41]. Domestically, the direct impacts of extreme weather are evident, with a 'caution' fire risk alert issued nationwide due to heavy snowfall, cold waves, and strong winds [3, 4]. The Cortina d'Ampezzo region in Italy has declared a state of emergency due to climate change and is responding by producing artificial snow [1].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 South Korea's Steps Towards Renewable Energy Transition and Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "South Korea has been designated as the chair country for the upcoming International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) General Assembly, seizing a significant opportunity to lead global discussions on renewable energy [17, 19, 20, 25, 27, 30, 31]. Domestically, POSCO Steelion is accelerating towards carbon neutrality goals by constructing solar power facilities [11]. Educational institutions like Jeju National University and Ulsan National University are also contributing to strengthening carbon neutrality capabilities through fostering environmental engineering talent and operating greenhouse gas academies [12, 13]. Carbon neutrality efforts are continuing across various sectors, including Pohang City's expanded distribution of household food waste disposers [14], Jeonbuk Self-Governing Province's target of achieving 91.1% renewable energy self-sufficiency by 2030 [23], and the government's promotion of turning livestock manure into renewable energy [29]. Furthermore, HMM is actively introducing wind-assisted propulsion systems, leading the eco-friendly transition in the shipping sector [33].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Challenges in Achieving Renewable Energy Targets: Infrastructure and Policy Limitations",
        "content": "Considering the low efficiency of fossil fuels, the transition to renewable energy is essential [15]. However, the target of achieving 100GW of renewable energy by 2030 is accompanied by significant infrastructure issues. Specifically, substation problems in the Honam and Jeju regions are delaying the achievement of this goal [24], and we face a 'paradoxical' situation of expanding renewable energy without expanding the transmission grid [26]. Experts point out the limitations of renewable energy facilities, emphasizing the need to find alternative solutions within regional power systems [28], and suggest that a transition to a 'region-led power market' is urgent to achieve 100GW of renewable energy by 2030 [21].",
        "tone": "warning"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Policy Controversies and Psychological Barriers",
        "content": "Policy controversies surrounding climate change response continue in the international community. The United States' move to withdraw from the UN Climate Change Convention has been criticized by some experts as potentially illegal [36, 51], which could negatively impact global climate cooperation. Simultaneously, research has been published indicating that 'psychological biases' risk slowing climate change progress [38], and anxieties about having children amidst the climate crisis also exist [35]. Furthermore, the U.S. plan for oil development in Venezuela has raised concerns about potentially depleting 13% of the world's remaining carbon budget for the 1.5°C target by 2050 [50], demonstrating the severe impact of energy policies on climate goals. Amidst these circumstances, scientific efforts to uncover clues about climate change through marine sediment research are ongoing [43].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, climate change is profoundly impacting our lives and societies worldwide in various forms. Efforts to transition to renewable energy must continue, but a thorough review and urgent development of solutions for the infrastructure and policy limitations arising during this process are critical. This concludes today's climate briefing."
