        "title": "🔴 Retreat in Global Climate Policy and Warnings from the International Community",
        "content": "While calls for fulfilling climate change response obligations are growing louder within the international community, some major countries are observing policy retreats [13]. Specifically, the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew findings that served as the scientific basis for U.S. climate change response, making decisions that limit climate change response authority [21, 23]. In response, California leaders voiced opposition and expressed concern over the Trump administration's reversal of historical decisions regarding greenhouse gas regulations [15]. This imbalance in international sentiment could act as a serious impediment to addressing the climate crisis.",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Domestic Ecosystem Changes and the Paradox of the Carbon Neutrality Challenge",
        "content": "Domestically, direct impacts of climate change on ecosystems are being observed. Warmer waters have been observed changing the breeding signals of frogs, causing them to produce mating calls more quickly, raising concerns about the restructuring of amphibian ecosystems [1]. Furthermore, in Hongseong County, South Chungcheong Province, last year saw a sharp decline in surf clam production due to extreme weather events like heatwaves, but this year's harvest has recovered, leading to a surge in demand. This clearly illustrates the profound impact of climate change on local specialty products [11]. Meanwhile, Stellantis's resumption of diesel car production due to a slump in the electric vehicle (EV) market represents a move counter to carbon neutrality goals, putting the climate response efforts of domestic industries to the test [3].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Climate Action and Sustainable Efforts by Domestic Companies and Local Governments",
        "content": "Amidst these crises, domestic companies and local governments continue their efforts to address climate change. Coca-Cola has initiated nature-based solutions (NBS) for climate crisis response by creating a 2-hectare coastal disaster prevention forest in the Pohang area [2]. Furthermore, telecommunication companies are emphasizing carbon neutrality practices as part of their ESG management, which includes supporting partners and volunteer activities, thereby striving for sustainable development [4]. Pyeongchang County and the County Facilities Management Corporation have signed an agreement to install renewable energy facilities in public parking lots, contributing to regional-level renewable energy transition [7].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Energy Transition Discussions and Warnings of Gradual Climate Change",
        "content": "Domestically, deep contemplation on energy transition continues, with debates between nuclear power and renewable energy regarding the direction of energy policy returning to square one [6]. Amidst these discussions, the international community is issuing warnings about the gradual progression of climate change. Japan's 'godless' lake symbolically illustrates the slowly approaching dangers of climate change, urging us to take climate action from a long-term perspective [22, 25]. This reminds us that beyond immediate debates, the urgent establishment of fundamental solutions for future generations is paramount.",
