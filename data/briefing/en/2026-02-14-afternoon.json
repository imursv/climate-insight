      {
        "title": "🔴 Rollback of U.S. Climate Policy and Global Repercussions",
        "content": "According to news reported today, the abolition of the legal basis for greenhouse gas regulations and the withdrawal of key scientific conclusions that supported climate change response are becoming visible in the United States [3, 5, 26]. This decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concludes that climate change does not threaten public health, and Arizona organizations are condemning it as 'reckless' [10, 12, 19]. This could lead to increased vehicle pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. skies, posing serious health risks. Analyses suggest this represents a retreat from carbon neutrality policies or an 'assault' of 'energy realism' [6, 11, 13, 20, 21].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Ecological and Social Impacts of Climate Change",
        "content": "The direct impacts of climate change are deeply infiltrating our ecosystems and daily lives. Domestically, the observation of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins migrating as far north as Gangneung due to climate change warns of accelerating marine ecosystem changes [1]. Internationally, research indicates that warming ice is awakening microbes that could accelerate climate change [27], and chart analysis showing a decrease in the number of Winter Olympic host cities demonstrates the impact of climate change on the sports sector [23]. In the UK, constant rain, described as 'seasons in disarray,' has led to flood warnings, severely disrupting life and livelihoods in rural areas [31]. Furthermore, the argument is being made that the cost of climate change should be measured in people, not money, emphasizing the importance of endangered species assessments [18].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response Efforts and Challenges",
        "content": "Even amidst the rollback of U.S. climate policy, the international community continues its diverse efforts to address climate change. The U.S. is demonstrating diplomatic complexities, including pressuring Vanuatu at the UN regarding the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s climate change ruling [8]. However, at the Munich Security Conference, Governor Newsom showed positive momentum by advancing climate action and partnerships [9]. At the African Union (AU) Summit, climate change was also a major agenda item [15]. Furthermore, letters urging action on climate change and voices encouraging support for the Climate Change Superfund bill continue, calling for sustained international attention and effort [16, 17].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts for Climate Response and Adaptation",
        "content": "Domestically, concrete efforts to respond to and adapt to climate change are ongoing. The Korea National Arboretum has published an 'Evaluation Guideline' to diagnose the effectiveness of climate response education, contributing to the establishment of a systematic educational system [2]. Furthermore, practical adaptation measures in the agricultural sector are being sought, such as providing a 'digital calendar' to inform farmers of the fluctuating citrus pest control periods due to climate change [4]. In the rural and fishing village renewable energy sector, efforts are underway to find breakthroughs through 'on-site communication' and 'regulatory improvements' [7]. These are considered important steps towards strengthening domestic climate resilience and ensuring a sustainable future.",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, climate change presents a severe global challenge, yet simultaneously, diverse efforts to overcome it are continuously underway. Only sustained attention and action can safeguard the future for all of us. This concludes today's climate briefing."
