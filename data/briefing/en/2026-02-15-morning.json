      {
        "title": "🔴 The Climate Crisis: Past and Present Warnings",
        "content": "Research published today revealed that the collapse of the Western Zhou Dynasty 3,000 years ago was caused by climate change and internal strife, rather than the previously accepted theory, thus re-emphasizing the historical impact of the climate crisis on human civilization [1, 4, 5]. Currently, climate change is severely threatening the future of the Winter Olympics, with warnings raised domestically and internationally about the limitations of artificial snow [3, 10]. Furthermore, the fact that the stoat, a weasel-family animal and mascot for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, is already endangered due to climate change demonstrates that this threat is not limited to human activities but is ongoing across entire ecosystems [19]. This clearly indicates that climate change is not merely a future problem, but an urgent challenge requiring us to learn from the past and actively respond to present threats.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Society's Climate Policy and Regulatory Reversals",
        "content": "Within the international community, policy confusion and movements towards regulatory reversals in response to climate change are being observed. The United States exerted pressure on Vanuatu at the UN regarding the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) landmark climate change advisory opinion, creating tension in international cooperation [9]. Furthermore, criticisms and concerns about the past Trump administration's climate change policy reversals and deregulation efforts have been re-highlighted, with growing voices asserting that such policies would undermine environmental safety [14, 15, 18]. More recently, Democratic senators have launched an investigation into the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) repeal of key air pollution enforcement measures, indicating rising concerns over the weakening of climate and environmental regulations even within some nations [20]. Amidst this situation, Stubb once again emphasized that climate change is an undeniable threat [17].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚖️ Legal Disputes over Climate Change Responsibility and International Obligations",
        "content": "Legal disputes over climate change responsibility and calls for the international community to fulfill its obligations continue. UN member states are being urged to implement their climate change obligations in accordance with Vanuatu's draft resolution, underscoring the importance of international legal accountability [11]. However, legal proceedings seeking to hold corporations accountable for climate change are still facing difficulties, as exemplified by the dismissal of Caraboro's 'deception' lawsuit against Duke Energy due to 'unclear claims' [12, 16]. Meanwhile, efforts to convey the voices of nations suffering from climate change on the international stage are also ongoing, such as the case of an FIU graduate student representing Pakistan at COP30 [13].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Science Research and Sustainability Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, efforts to enhance scientific understanding of climate change and transition towards a sustainable society are proceeding in parallel. Recent research has observed an active generation of aerosols in the atmosphere as heatwaves become more frequent, revealing the complex impacts of climate change on the atmospheric environment [2]. Based on this scientific understanding, domestic telecommunication companies are actively implementing ESG management, fulfilling their corporate social responsibility through partner support, volunteer activities, and carbon neutrality practices [6]. Additionally, educational and promotional activities encouraging public understanding and participation in renewable energy are actively underway, such as the special operation of the Buan Renewable Energy Theme Experience Center during the Lunar New Year holiday [7, 8].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has illuminated various facets of the climate crisis, once again reminding us of the urgent need for international cooperation and proactive responses both domestically and internationally. This concludes the climate briefing for February 14, 2026."
