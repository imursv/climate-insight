      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Adaptation and Agricultural Innovation",
        "content": "Domestically, multifaceted efforts are underway to mitigate damage and enhance productivity in the agricultural sector due to climate change. Muju County is promoting a pilot project for new technologies in income-generating crops to address climate change and the aging farming population [1]. Furthermore, a specialized water-based paint has been developed to prevent frost damage to fruit trees, which is expected to curb soaring fruit prices caused by extreme weather events [2, 3]. In addition, Yangyang County is helping to strengthen farmers' capabilities by imparting key climate change response technologies through its 2026 New Year's Practical Education for Farmers [4]. These technological advancements and educational initiatives will contribute to enhancing the resilience of the agricultural sector, which is directly impacted by climate change.",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Across South Korean society, there is active movement towards achieving carbon neutrality goals. Efforts are being made to accelerate carbon neutrality and balanced development through agricultural structural reform [5]. Gongju National University is promoting improved citizen awareness and education on carbon neutrality, collaborating with environmental education organizations in South Chungcheong Province to foster civic talent [6, 10]. The Korea Environment Corporation is emphasizing practical implementation by addressing carbon neutrality projects on-site in 2026 [7]. Governor Kim Tae-heum of South Chungcheong Province has articulated a vision to lead the future of South Korea by focusing on five key tasks, including smart farms and carbon neutrality [8]. Korea Midland Power also plans to actively pursue carbon neutrality implementation and respond to the major AI transition in its 2026 headquarters work report [9]. Meanwhile, the revised Korean Green Taxonomy has been implemented, further categorizing solar, wind, and hydropower generation [11], and Kumho Petrochemical Group has reduced carbon emissions through strengthened environmental management [12]. Jeollanam-do Province has presented a vision to attract power-intensive industries based on renewable energy and to play a central role in the region with AI and renewable energy [13, 16]. The case of Guyang-ri village, where residents enjoy free lunches and bus benefits thanks to solar power generation, demonstrates the positive effects of renewable energy [20].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Realistic Challenges and Debates in Domestic Energy Policy",
        "content": "Domestic energy policy faces realistic challenges alongside its continuous development. A recent public opinion poll indicated that 50.9% of the public positively assesses the government's energy policy, favoring an appropriate mix of new and renewable energy and nuclear power [14]. However, arguments have also been made that the coexistence of nuclear power and renewable energy, along with ensuring flexibility, is essential [17]. Nevertheless, critical opinions have emerged regarding the solar and nuclear energy mix policy, pointing to high cost issues [18]. There is also growing concern that energy policy is becoming polarized along ideological lines and political affiliations, turning even specialized areas into subjects of political contention [19]. This is evident in events such as a press conference by civic groups condemning the approval of the Kori Unit 2 nuclear power plant's life extension, suggesting an urgent need for an integrated approach [19].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Action and Deepening Climate Impacts",
        "content": "The international community is making various efforts to address climate change, but simultaneously faces severe impacts of climate change. Montgomery County and Delaware have announced progress or updated plans for achieving climate change goals [21, 23]. Valley Water is exploring concrete action plans, such as a climate change action plan targeting 2025, and Vermont has introduced a climate change education bill [25, 26]. The City of Tualatin implemented optional fees for climate change mitigation [27], Kintetsu World Express was selected for the CDP 2025 Climate Change A List [36], and Telford and Wrekin Council reported positive news of achieving a 63% carbon reduction on its journey towards carbon neutrality [40]. However, the threat of climate change is intensifying. In the Bay Area, King Tides are expected to increase [22], and a shift in North Pacific storm tracks towards the poles has been observed [31]. California experienced a deadly avalanche and marked the one-year anniversary of the LA County wildfires, with warnings also issued that climate change could affect Nor'easters [34]. Alongside reports of inhibited tree growth in Switzerland [38], the shocking news that even countries achieving 100% solar energy could face survival threats within this century due to climate change serves as a stark reminder of the severity of the climate crisis [33]. Sea levels are rising faster than at any other time in human history, and the warning that 100 million people could lose their homes with every one-foot rise indicates a global threat [41]. Even the issue of pollen allergies has revealed political divisions surrounding climate change [35].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "As you have seen in today's briefing, efforts in technology development and policy formulation to address climate change are continuing both domestically and internationally. However, at the same time, the threats posed by climate change are becoming increasingly real. This is a critical juncture where stability in energy policy, the achievement of social consensus, and close monitoring of the impacts of climate change on the international community are particularly necessary. This concludes today's climate briefing for January 7, 2026."
