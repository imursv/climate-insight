    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Unprecedented Retreat in U.S. Climate Policy",
        "content": "The administration of former U.S. President Trump is undertaking an unprecedented retreat in climate change response, amplifying concerns within the international community. He has officially abolished U.S. greenhouse gas regulations [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10], dismantled the foundation of climate regulations maintained for 17 years, and even withdrawn the finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger [3, 27, 49, 56]. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s authority to address climate change has been virtually nullified [21, 54], and despite numerous studies identifying climate change as a health risk, criticisms are spreading that he has called it a 'hoax' and eliminated the agency's ability to protect public health [35, 37, 54]. These actions are dismantling the U.S.'s capacity to respond to climate change [33] and are facing strong backlash, with some regions, such as Connecticut, signaling legal disputes [25, 43, 53].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Warning Bells of Accelerating Global Warming",
        "content": "Reports continue to emerge, demonstrating that the acceleration of global warming is becoming a tangible threat. Temperatures in Italy's Cortina region have risen by 3.6 degrees over the past 70 years [1, 6], raising serious questions about the feasibility of hosting future Winter Olympics [36, 46]. Scientists warn that the Earth has already entered a phase of 'unprecedented climate change' [51], leading to a reduction in the number of cities capable of hosting the Winter Olympics [36]. This situation clearly shows that climate change is not merely an environmental issue but directly impacts human life and culture.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community Explores Diverse Climate Responses",
        "content": "The international community continues various discussions and efforts to address climate change. An advisory opinion on climate change has been presented by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and calls are emerging to translate this into concrete action through a new UN resolution [22, 48]. Vietnamese cities emphasize the need to accelerate the implementation of climate change response projects [7], and climate change was also a major agenda item at the African Union (AU) Summit [28]. Meanwhile, France has outlined a policy direction in its '10-year energy roadmap' to increase nuclear power while slowing the pace of renewable energy growth [19, 20], demonstrating that countries are adjusting their energy policies to suit their specific circumstances.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, positive movements are actively underway to achieve carbon neutrality goals and transition to renewable energy. Pohang City is striving to strengthen its international climate leadership by holding promotional briefings to host the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) [8], and Gimpo City is encouraging the practice of carbon neutrality through eco-friendly agriculture education [13]. The National Institute of Ecology is participating in the 'Public Institution K-RE100 Launch Ceremony' to join the renewable energy transition [14], and Gwangmyeong City is setting an example by establishing an 'energy virtuous cycle' model that returns renewable energy savings to society [18]. These efforts are being hailed as a 'giant first step' towards renewable energy transition [16], laying crucial groundwork for a sustainable future.",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the contrasting movements within the international community regarding climate change, and once again emphasizes the importance of responsible action and cooperation among nations in the face of a global crisis. This concludes the climate briefing for February 13, 2026."
