      {
        "title": "🔴 Direct Threats of Climate Change and Their Ripple Effects",
        "content": "News reported today clearly demonstrates that the direct threats posed by climate change and their ripple effects are spreading globally. Due to climate change, species that have migrated to the Arctic Ocean are struggling to establish themselves [1, 15, 23], and climate change is being identified as the cause of a series of cardiac arrest incidents on Aconcagua, South America's highest peak [5]. In South Korea, Jeju agriculture faces crop conversion not as an option, but as an essential task [10], internationally, droughts are exacerbating their impact on power grids [97], and warnings have emerged that some countries could disappear by 2050 due to climate change [99]. Furthermore, the burden of climate change disproportionately falls on the poor, leading to unequal costs for survival [103], and news that even the insurance industry is being pushed to its limits [101] suggests that the climate crisis is not merely an environmental issue but threatens the stability of society as a whole.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts in Climate Change Adaptation and Infrastructure Improvement",
        "content": "Amidst these threats, active efforts are underway domestically to proactively respond to and adapt to climate change. The Jeju region is undergoing a turning point in preparing for climate change by significantly expanding and maintaining its sewage infrastructure [2, 8, 12, 16, 18, 24], and Naju City held a council meeting to strengthen the competitiveness of 'Naju Pears' in response to climate change [4, 14, 17, 19, 21]. The Rural Development Administration is reviewing technologies for preventing frost damage to apples [11, 25], and activities to assist with on-site diagnosis of crop diseases and pests are also taking place [7]. Furthermore, attempts to find solutions to the climate crisis and local issues in nature [9], and the fact that companies like Ecolab and Aptar have achieved top ratings in CDP assessments, demonstrating global leadership in climate change response [6, 13, 102, 105], are considered positive advancements.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Practices and Technological Innovations Towards Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "News of various practices and technological innovations aimed at achieving carbon neutrality also continued. Foodist is implementing carbon neutrality through its 'Zero Food Waste' campaign, operating a citizen-participatory model [26, 30, 37, 39, 42], and initiatives to reuse discarded plastics as raw materials are being promoted, contributing to carbon neutrality [29]. Heat pumps show the potential to become a carbon-neutral savior, handling 55% of heating and cooling by 2050 [28], but warnings have also been raised that achieving carbon neutrality is impossible without thermal energy policies [41]. The Korea Environment Corporation is recruiting for its greenhouse gas management professional training program [38, 43], and the National Chuncheon Forest Recreation Center is operating teacher training to spread carbon-neutral forest education [35], thus strengthening carbon neutrality capabilities across society [31, 32, 33, 36, 40].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Accelerated Transition to Renewable Energy and Current Challenges",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy is a global trend, and while various advancements have been made both domestically and internationally, challenges that need to be addressed have also become clear. In Europe, the share of renewable energy in the energy mix has surpassed fossil fuels for the first time [53], and in a domestic public opinion poll, renewable energy was selected as the number one energy source requiring expansion [61]. The Korea Power Exchange is fully implementing the semi-centralized dispatch system for renewable energy starting this spring, aiming for flexible operation [44, 56, 75, 76, 79, 81, 87], and Hyundai Engineering & Construction is driving the achievement of K-RE100 by securing large-scale renewable energy PPAs [69, 77]. However, a U.S. Secretary of Commerce sparked international controversy with remarks suggesting 'using more coal instead of renewable energy' [60, 67], and warnings continue that if the recognition of air-source heat pumps as renewable energy is rushed without clear standards, it could lead to adverse effects [50, 70, 74, 82]. Furthermore, difficulties in the offshore wind power project off Ulsan [89] and controversy over the unfairness of Gyeongju City's new and renewable energy supply project announcement [64] demonstrate the critical importance of policy and procedural transparency and rationality in the process of expanding renewable energy.",
        "tone": "warning"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have seen in today's briefing, climate change presents an urgent challenge to humanity, but at the same time, diverse response efforts and technological advancements are offering a beacon of hope. Continued attention and action are ever more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
