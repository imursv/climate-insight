      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis, Realization of Domestic and International Damages",
        "content": "The domestic agricultural sector is directly impacted by climate change. Even farmers who had switched from apple cultivation to peach due to difficulties are now facing challenges in peach cultivation [1, 4], demonstrating that climate change poses a severe threat across the entire agricultural ecosystem. The industrial sector is also facing difficulties in achieving carbon neutrality, with increasing burdens, leading to calls for urgent strategic breakthroughs [7]. Internationally, global carbon emissions have reached an all-time high, with scientists warning of worsening climate disasters [23], and South Asia is identified as both a contributor to and a victim of the climate crisis [25]. Furthermore, changes in Brazil's dry regions are leading to a situation where 'if you plant something, it dies' [29], and the IMF warns of a potential 2% annual GDP loss for the Philippines [28], indicating that the economic and social ripple effects of the climate crisis are spreading across all sectors.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Transition and Policy Implementation",
        "content": "Various local governments in Korea are actively working towards achieving carbon neutrality goals. Suncheon City is making swift progress in responding to climate change by promoting its 'Suncheon-type RE-100' policy [5], and Uiseong County has been recognized as an exemplary local government, winning the Gyeongsangbuk-do Environmental Grand Prize for two consecutive years [6]. Geochang County has pledged to lead in carbon neutrality by setting a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 76.8% by 2034 [8], and the Seoul Metropolitan Council has laid the groundwork for carbon neutrality-linked policies through the revision of its sustainable tourism ordinance [12]. Furthermore, the Ansan Environmental Foundation, acting as a Carbon Neutrality Support Center, assists small and medium-sized enterprises with ESG management diagnostics and consulting [11], and the Korea Expressway Corporation plans to expand the scale of highway solar power generation next year [15], demonstrating diverse efforts towards transitioning to a carbon-neutral society.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Industry's Response to Climate Change and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "The industrial sector is seizing the climate crisis as a new opportunity, accelerating technological innovation and business restructuring. HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has been recognized for its eco-friendly management efforts, achieving the highest rating in climate change response evaluations [3, 16], and the search for technology-based solutions is active, with events being held to hear on-site voices in the climate tech sector [2]. Lotte Chemical is pursuing fundamental changes in industrial structure, participating in the government's petrochemical industry restructuring by advancing business reorganization at the Yeosu Industrial Complex and submitting plans for integrating and adjusting redundant facilities [18]. Furthermore, the UK's Lotus Cars is joining the trend of eco-friendly mobility transition by unveiling its first electric vehicle model while simultaneously presenting its last internal combustion engine sports car [17]. These movements demonstrate that companies are perceiving climate change response not merely as a cost, but as an opportunity to secure future competitiveness.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Action and New Approaches",
        "content": "The international community is exploring various strategies to address climate change. Turkey has been selected as the host for the 2026 Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention (COP31), preparing to establish a platform for international discussions [24]. New Jersey plans to spend $11 million in 2026 to combat climate change by utilizing nature itself [22]. In Hawaii, a new cruise ship tax is expected to generate funds for climate change solutions and coastal protection [26]. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Alberta are deepening scientific understanding by conducting studies to quantify the climate change impacts of carbon emissions from permafrost [19]. However, there are also cases, such as in the UK, where despite leading in renewable energy, an aging power grid is hampered by increased electricity demand due to the AI boom [14]. Furthermore, an analysis suggesting that the 'green doom' narrative on climate change has led to disastrous outcomes for activists [27] indicates the importance of effective communication strategies.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis along with diverse response efforts both domestically and internationally. Through continued interest and cooperation, we must build a more resilient future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
