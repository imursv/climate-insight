        "title": "🔴 Current Status of Domestic Climate Adaptation and Policy Challenges",
        "content": "Today, a significant discrepancy in the field efforts for climate crisis adaptation has become evident domestically. The Korea Forest Service is afforesting tree species vulnerable to climate change, and it has been revealed that 70% of these afforested species are inconsistent with on-site conditions, raising concerns [1, 5]. Amidst this situation, an independent bill focused on climate crisis 'adaptation' has been proposed, aiming to comprehensively reorganize the disaster response system [3]. The government is also pursuing policies that encompass everything from youth health management to responses to heatwaves and cold snaps, attempting to overcome vulnerabilities in the era of climate change [12]. Meanwhile, as the deadline for amending the Carbon Neutrality Act, which was ruled 'unconstitutional,' has passed and been postponed to May, the public discourse process to secure the legislative legitimacy of this bill is expected to become even more crucial [13, 19, 23, 25].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Status and Debates on Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts to expand renewable energy are ongoing, but they face several challenges, including safety blind spots in eco-friendly renewable energy facilities and opposition from some labor unions regarding the establishment of public renewable energy enterprises [27, 28, 29, 37]. Nevertheless, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) has successfully secured $500 million in renewable energy project financing in Guam, USA, continuing its international expansion of renewable energy businesses [31, 42, 45, 49, 50]. Furthermore, innovative market models are being introduced, such as opening avenues for direct purchase of renewable energy in data centers and special distributed energy zones, and the full-scale launch of distributed energy experiments allowing the buying and selling of electricity charged in EV batteries [32, 39, 40, 44]. These movements, coupled with analyses indicating that the expansion of solar and wind energy is transforming the global power structure, are expected to accelerate changes in the domestic power market [41].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Impacts of Climate Change and Responses by the International Community",
        "content": "Globally, the impacts of climate change are intensifying. In the United States, cold snaps are felt to be unusually severe [52, 66, 71, 72, 79, 82, 85], and extreme weather phenomena, contrary to predictions, are emerging, with Washington D.C. experiencing its coldest winter in 30 years [83, 84]. These climate changes threaten the future of the Winter Olympics, pushing the event to a limit where even artificial snow cannot save it [54, 59, 68]. Severe impacts across ecosystems and society are being reported, including the loss of coastal communities due to sea-level rise [80], the endangerment of African penguins [86], and pressure on Bangladesh's healthcare system [77]. Greenpeace is urging the withdrawal of oil sponsors from the Winter Olympics, thereby intensifying international pressure for climate crisis response [75].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts for Achieving Carbon Neutrality Goals",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis are continuing across various sectors. Domestically, a public discourse committee has been launched to discuss greenhouse gas reduction pathways from 2036 to 2049 [15], and Hyundai Steel is contributing to accelerating carbon neutrality by commercializing hybrid steelmaking technology for the first time in the world [21]. Chonnam National University is emphasizing the importance of international cooperation by establishing a Carbon Neutrality International Joint Research Institute with Yangzhou University in China [17]. Internationally, the Virginia House of Delegates has passed a bill to rejoin climate change agreements [51], and West Sussex County Council is accelerating towards carbon neutrality through innovative energy initiatives [88]. These multifaceted efforts are spreading the awareness that responding to the climate crisis must become a new growth engine and a just transition [22].",
