        "title": "🔴 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Imminent Threats",
        "content": "The 1.5-degree global average temperature increase threshold is expected to be breached within five years, and 2025 was reported as the third warmest year on record, with global warming reaching 1.4°C [9, 83, 94]. If these climate changes are left unaddressed, half of Seoul's plant species could disappear by 2100 [1], and the future of the Winter Olympics is being reshaped globally, with the number of potential host regions decreasing, making the feasibility of hosting in areas like Utah uncertain after 2034 [6, 89, 96, 98-99, 101, 103-105, 107, 109, 111-115, 117-120, 123-124]. Climate change is causing widespread socioeconomic and environmental threats, including reduced U.S. income, an impending groundwater crisis, worsening drug resistance, difficulties in pain management, and threats to aquaculture feed supply, with billions of dollars in natural disaster damages anticipated in 2025 [85, 95, 86, 91, 90, 116, 102, 121]. Meanwhile, NASA's omission of climate change mentions while reporting record heat raises questions about the importance of climate crisis communication [92, 97, 100, 106, 108, 122, 125].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Transition and Challenges",
        "content": "Domestically, efforts towards carbon neutrality to address the climate crisis are accelerating in various sectors. Ahead of the 2027 Chungcheong Universiade, Sejong City is pushing for sustainable urban environment creation through a 'two-track' approach of urban environmental improvement, carbon neutrality realization, and garden city development, exceeding its greenhouse gas reduction target by 120% [11, 12, 13, 27, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 40, 44, 45, 52]. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and its affiliated public institutions plan to actively respond to the climate crisis by strengthening climate change monitoring and prediction [4, 5], while Gyeongsangbuk-do and Chungcheongbuk-do are responding to climate change by leading a major transformation in fisheries, fostering marine tourism, and promoting carbon-neutral livestock and aquaculture industries, respectively [3, 35]. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) is promoting a 250 billion KRW corporate-participatory carbon neutrality support project this year, encouraging industrial transition, and LG Group is also making its ESG management achievements visible with the goal of achieving net-zero by 2050 [23, 28, 20, 51]. However, the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector repeatedly emphasizes the urgent need for rationalization of environmental and energy regulations and government support for carbon-neutral transition [14, 15, 16, 18, 25, 38, 46, 48, 50], and Seongnam City also faces the urgent task of establishing a carbon neutrality standard model [24], indicating that practical support and policy development remain crucial challenges.",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Renewable Energy and Active Policy Discussions",
        "content": "In the renewable energy sector, the enactment of a 'Special Act on the Promotion of Renewable Energy Installation and Trading (tentative name)' is being pursued [54], and KEPCO E&C aims to expand its global leadership in the new and renewable energy sector [55]. Uijeongbu City's wastewater treatment plant is gaining attention as an eco-friendly energy complex facility, transforming into a new and renewable energy production hub alongside wastewater treatment [57, 73, 77, 78], and corporate investments in renewable energy transition are continuing, with Kolon Industries, for example, establishing a 2.4MW solar power facility at its Gumi plant [81]. The KMA plans to strengthen preparedness for climate disasters and launch renewable energy weather services [65, 66], which is expected to support the stable operation of renewable energy. However, industry and experts are protesting the designation of air source heat pumps as renewable energy, urging a halt to the policy [59, 61, 76], and criticisms are being raised against 'reckless and indiscriminate renewable energy expansion,' citing unstandardized recognition and tax expenditures [75], highlighting the importance of careful policy discussions and the establishment of reasonable standards in the renewable energy transition process.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Response and New Trends",
        "content": "The international community is responding to climate change in various ways and showing new trends. The UK has signed contracts for 8.4GW of offshore wind power, moving closer to its 50GW target by 2030 [69], and Seychelles is exploring innovative solutions, such as investing in coral sexual reproduction to create resilient coral reefs against climate change [126]. Mitsubishi UFJ is supporting renewable energy projects in the Philippines [68], and private sector climate action is also active, with seven winter resorts fighting against climate change [110]. Analyses of current trends and economic impacts of climate change litigation are actively underway [84, 121], and academic participation continues, with a professor from Western Illinois University attending the UN Climate Change Conference [93]. However, concerns are also being raised about some regressive policy decisions, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it would stop calculating healthcare cost savings and prevented deaths from air pollution regulations [127], and experts like historian Adam Tooze emphasize the importance of the climate emergency in understanding the 'radical new world' we have entered [128].",

    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis alongside various domestic and international response efforts. We anticipate stronger climate action through continued attention and cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
