        "title": "🔴 Severe Impacts of Climate Change and Warnings of Policy Reversals",
        "content": "Domestically, concerns have been raised that rising temperatures could lead to a decrease in male birth rates, potentially affecting the future population structure [1, 5]. Internationally, climate change is directly impacting ecosystems in specific regions of the United States, leading to issues such as the suspension of leaf collection [138] and disruption of newt migration [139]. Furthermore, policy reversals have been observed, such as the Trump administration weakening the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) climate change response mechanisms [135] and making a determination that climate change does not threaten public health [140], leading to warnings that this could accelerate the progression of global warming [144]. This reinforces domestic and international calls that effective suppression is more crucial than prevention in an era of climate crisis wildfires [18], and that climate change issues should not be sidelined in politics [149].",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Progress Towards Domestic Carbon Neutrality Goals and Expansion of Climate Finance",
        "content": "Domestically, diverse efforts are continuing towards achieving carbon neutrality. Several organizations, including the Korea SMEs and Startups Agency (KOSME), Korea Transportation Safety Authority (TS), and Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS), have been recognized for their carbon neutrality achievements and awarded the 'Korea Green Climate Award' [11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 22, 40]. The government announced plans to invest 790 trillion won in climate finance over the next 10 years to achieve its 'carbon neutrality' goal [25, 52], signaling large-scale investment. It also decided to gradually mandate ESG disclosures starting in 2028, with a three-year grace period for Scope 3 disclosures [131]. Furthermore, various local governments, including Uiseong-gun and Uijeongbu-si, are encouraging residents to save energy and practice automotive carbon neutrality through the Carbon Neutrality Point system, offering incentives to promote participation [24, 29, 30, 34, 44, 45, 50]. Boryeong-si is emerging as a leading carbon-neutral city with the groundbreaking of its green hydrogen production base [51], and the Korea Forest Service and OCI Holdings have signed an agreement to restore vegetation in coastal reclaimed land and establish a carbon-neutral model, demonstrating active cooperation for carbon neutrality across various sectors [48].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Renewable Energy Supply and Introduction of Innovative Technologies",
        "content": "In the renewable energy sector, Daegu Metropolitan City achieved a cumulative supply of 487MW, ranking first among all special and metropolitan cities nationwide, demonstrating success in energy transition despite challenging conditions [54, 58, 59, 62, 64, 70, 73, 74, 76, 78, 86, 88, 91, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 103, 104, 112, 116, 117]. In terms of technological innovation, LS Electric has developed and completed verification of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based renewable energy generation forecasting model [55, 61, 67, 75, 79, 81, 84, 89, 93, 97, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 115, 119, 123, 124, 126, 128, 129], accelerating its power brokerage business, and notably achieved a high accuracy of 92% in forecasting Jeju wind power generation [79, 109]. The Korea National Railway (KNR) is accelerating the adoption of renewable energy in various sectors, including promoting 'railway-type renewable energy' by integrating solar power technology into railway infrastructure through cooperation with Hanwha Qcells [57, 66, 72, 83, 87, 107]. Muan-gun is simultaneously achieving energy independence and welfare through the widespread adoption of new and renewable energy [63, 71], and the Saemangeum region is also envisioning a major transition based on renewable energy [77, 85, 95], highlighting regional efforts towards renewable energy transition.",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Local Community Efforts for Climate Change Adaptation and Awareness Raising",
        "content": "Local governments are actively responding to climate change. Cheonan City has established infrastructure and conducted on-site inspections to proactively respond to climate crises and forest disasters [2, 7, 14, 15]. Yecheon-gun and Changnyeong-gun are supporting secure farming practices that adapt to climate change through on-site consulting for high-quality watermelon cultivation and capacity-building education [6, 10]. Jeju Province is focusing on green remodeling as a simultaneous solution for carbon neutrality and stimulating the construction economy, accelerating projects through deregulation and the introduction of eco-friendly technologies [20, 21, 36, 39, 53]. The Cheongju Land Climate Change Experience Center will reopen on March 4, introducing experiential content to contribute to raising citizens' awareness of climate change [3, 4, 8, 9]. The Seoul Energy Dream Center successfully concluded its Carbon Neutrality Experience Center Citizen Docent Workshop, strengthening its role as a bridge connecting citizens with carbon neutrality [35, 41].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Policy Trends and Challenges",
        "content": "The international community is facing various policy discussions and challenges in responding to climate change. The UK is developing technical rules and guidelines for its climate change agreement, targeting 2026 [145]. Scotland has shown progress in reducing emissions [150], but its new emissions strategy has also been criticized for 'relying too heavily on science fiction' [151]. Meanwhile, in the United States, bipartisan solutions to climate change are being sought through 'climate realism' [134], and research is underway on a multi-stage modeling framework for a feasible and equitable portfolio of land-based climate mitigation technologies [137]. South Korea and Türkiye are discussing expanding cooperation across the energy sector, including nuclear power, renewable energy, and SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) [65, 101, 122, 125, 127], continuing international efforts towards energy transition. However, complex interconnections between climate policy, economy, and trade are also being highlighted, such as discussions on whether climate change exacerbates inflation [132] and a WTO dispute with China over India's battery and electric vehicle subsidies [130].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severe impacts of climate change, alongside ongoing concrete efforts both domestically and internationally towards carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition. Diversified approaches and international cooperation will become even more crucial in responding to the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
