        "title": "🔴 Deepening Impacts of Climate Change and Domestic and International Ecosystem Changes",
        "content": "News collected today indicates that the direct impacts of climate change are deeply penetrating our ecosystems and daily lives. Domestically, the biological map of the Korean Peninsula is changing, with tropical moths being discovered on Heuksando Island [1], and the habitation of tropical species being confirmed among a total of approximately 62,000 national species [4, 12]. Reports that Wando County's average temperature has risen by more than 1 degree Celsius [3, 10] clearly demonstrate regional temperature increases, and extreme weather phenomena such as large-scale winter wildfires [8] are also continuing. Internationally, research findings [138] indicating that climate change is reducing the habitats of Himalayan wetland orchids [139] and increasing the global risk of leptospirosis warn of the widespread impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human health.",

      {
        "title": "⚠️ Domestic Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets: Need for Reconsideration of Effectiveness",
        "content": "Critical perspectives have also been raised regarding domestic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) issued a negative assessment on the feasibility of South Korea achieving its greenhouse gas reduction targets, pointing out the lack of clear reduction pathways [13, 14, 129]. Similarly, carbon neutrality master plans from domestic local governments have received 'failing grades' due to similar content and concerns about 'optical illusions' [6, 57, 60], with analyses also showing significant discrepancies between their 2030 reduction targets and the government's proposal [68]. The signature campaign opposing the construction of the Jeju Dongbok-ri gas power plant [19, 25] and environmental groups' opposition to the expansion of the Daejeon combined heat and power plant [126] reflect concerns about policies being pursued that run counter to carbon neutrality goals.",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Diverse Efforts for Transition to a Carbon-Neutral Society",
        "content": "Despite these concerns, diverse efforts for the transition to a carbon-neutral society are continuing. In Haenam County, the 'Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center,' a national carbon neutrality education facility, is on track to break ground in the second half of this year and aims for completion in 2028 [17, 26, 29, 34, 35, 42, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54, 71, 73, 74]. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education is fully implementing carbon neutrality practices in all schools and introducing an online self-diagnosis system [18, 27, 32, 37, 43, 69]. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups is supporting industrial transition by providing up to 300 million won per company through its carbon neutrality facility investment support program for SMEs [20, 28, 31, 40, 46, 58, 62, 64, 75]. Alongside these, various entities are continuing their efforts, including the Anseong Agricultural Technology Center and the Anseong City Federation of Korea Living Improvement Movement's carbon neutrality resolution ceremony [15, 22, 33, 36, 38, 56, 59, 66], and Kyobo Life Insurance's 'Hope Tree' donation in Vietnam [44, 63, 76].",

        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Renewable Energy and Exploration of New Energy Business Models",
        "content": "In the energy transition sector, the expansion of renewable energy and the exploration of new business models are actively underway. Samsung SDI and Korea East-West Power are strengthening domestic and international business cooperation in ESS (Energy Storage System) and renewable energy sectors, actively expanding into global markets [79, 88, 89, 94, 100, 101, 110, 111, 122]. Thanks to its performance in renewable energy projects, SK E&S recorded an operating profit of 53 billion won last year, a 41% increase from the previous year [80, 95]. Chungju City has been selected for the new and renewable energy convergence support project for nine consecutive years, securing 4.1 billion won in project funds [91, 93, 96, 103, 109, 114, 124]. Furthermore, the 3 trillion won Saemangeum floating solar power project is on track, with an agreement between four organizations aiming for early completion in 2029 [107, 112, 120, 121, 123, 125, 128]. Efforts to accelerate the renewable energy transition are continuing, with Jeollanam-do Province, for example, promoting the attraction and cultivation of excellent foreign talent in the new and renewable energy sector [82, 87, 90, 104, 105, 113, 116].",
