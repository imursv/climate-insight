    "opening": "Good morning. I will now begin the climate briefing for February 6, 2026. Based on the 66 climate-related news items collected today, I will present an overview of the general trends, ranging from the severe reality of climate change to domestic and international adaptation efforts, acceleration of renewable energy transition, and policy and social discussions.",

        "title": "🔴 The Severe Reality and Immediate Challenges of Climate Change",
        "content": "Eco-friendly golden apple snail farming methods are facing difficulties due to climate change [1, 6], and economic ripple effects are intensifying, with 'climateflation' threatening even food prices [5]. The Winter Olympics have reached a point where distributed hosting is being explored due to the impact of climate change [3, 41, 55], and in terms of human health, climate change has been confirmed to accelerate antibiotic resistance in the Western Pacific region [45, 46]. Furthermore, the speed and intensity of climate change are exceeding expectations, with a massive glacier collapsing in Antarctica in just two months and Europe experiencing extremely wet weather and severe cold [64, 65]. This situation calls for simultaneous responses, including accelerating greenhouse gas destruction, improving Earth system models, and regulating agricultural and industrial emissions [8], and shows that New Mexico families are already paying the true cost of climate change [40]. Amidst the demand for comprehensive crisis awareness, handicraft communities are also facing challenges due to climate change [50].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Climate Change Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, Gyeongguk National University is taking proactive steps, positioning itself as a control tower for plant security response amidst the climate crisis and hosting related academic conferences [2, 11]. Busan's Yeongdo District has achieved the highest rating in the national local government carbon neutrality plan evaluation [13, 15], and Gurye County is actively preparing for a carbon-neutral soil revitalization expo [18, 24], demonstrating vibrant community-level carbon neutrality practices. Efforts such as the Children's Forest School at Woraksan National Park [7], ginseng cultivation education in Pocheon City [9, 10], and 'Senior Resource Circulation Guardian' activities [19, 23] showcase climate change adaptation through education and citizen participation. In the National Assembly, a special bill on climate crisis adaptation has been proposed, raising expectations for the establishment of institutional foundations [12]. Internationally, Toyo Tire has been selected for the CDP Climate Change A List [47], and the Cocagne Community Garden in Canada is helping residents prepare for climate change [61], with climate action and resilience plans continuously being developed worldwide [53, 58].",

      },
      {
        "title": "♻️ Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "The global renewable energy market is rapidly expanding, with the High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) market projected to grow by 25.9% annually [25]. Domestically, the labor and management of the Han River Hydroelectric Power Plant have jointly declared the expansion of renewable energy and are finding solutions in hydropower [26, 32], actively participating in the renewable energy transition. Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) has also shown success in overseas markets by successfully attracting $500 million in project financing for a renewable energy power project in Guam, USA [33]. Shinhan Bank and Hanwha Solutions are strengthening financial cooperation in the US solar and North American renewable energy sectors [30, 34, 36, 37], expanding support for renewable energy investments. Internationally, companies are actively utilizing and investing in renewable energy, with Google, for example, signing a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 100MW of offshore wind power in Germany to secure AI power [38].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Expansion of Climate Policy and Social Discourse",
        "content": "Domestically, policy discussions are active, with efforts to utilize AI to respond to disaster situations altered by climate change and low birth rates coupled with an aging population [4], and the public discourse on amending the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act beginning ahead of its deadline [14]. Local councilors in Korea are holding public forums to expand renewable energy [31], encouraging grassroots climate action. Internationally, legal and civic pressures are intensifying, including arguments by lawyers demanding greenhouse gas emission limits in Pennsylvania [39], the introduction of legislation holding major oil companies accountable for climate change-induced disasters [42], and climate action lawsuits against the government by Swedish youth [51]. Meanwhile, academic and business approaches to climate change are also deepening, with Harvard Business School, for example, launching a short intensive program on AI and climate change [43]. These discussions are based on the recognition that climate change is humanity's most severe threat [49], emphasizing the need for genuine climate action and restraint, and seeking social consensus for a sustainable future [59].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has clearly demonstrated the various threats posed by climate change, along with active domestic and international efforts to overcome them, particularly highlighting the importance of accelerating the renewable energy transition and policy discussions. In this era of climate crisis, our collective sustained attention and action will become even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
