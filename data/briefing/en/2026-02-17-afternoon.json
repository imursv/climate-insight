    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 International Climate Crisis Warnings and Policy Uncertainty",
        "content": "The European Union's advisory body has warned of EU countries' insufficient preparedness for worsening climate change, emphasizing the need for 'urgent coordination' [15, 20, 42, 49]. This warning aligns with concerns from high-ranking officials that global warming has already reached its first tipping point, increasing security risks [30]. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has withdrawn its 'endangerment finding' mandating passenger car efficiency, potentially leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions [19, 32]. Policy uncertainties, such as the termination of tax credits and a 'tariff bomb' on parts, are directly impacting the market, causing a decrease in electric vehicle sales [14]. However, it is noteworthy that climate research in San Diego contributed scientific evidence to a groundbreaking government ruling that greenhouse gases threaten public health [35].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Direct Impacts of Climate Change and Ecological/Cultural Threats",
        "content": "The direct impacts of climate change are intensifying globally. In South Africa, nearly a million people have been affected by climate change-related floods [21], and loggerhead sea turtles face four multifaceted threats due to climate change [16]. Particularly in Greenland, as ice melts due to climate change, champion sled dog mushers are deeply concerned about the disappearance of their culture [17, 26, 33, 37, 38, 40, 41], indicating a cultural threat beyond mere environmental change. These threats raise questions about the continued viability of the Winter Olympics [34] and lead to increased long-term supply risks for specific ecosystems, such as declining hilsa fish catches [43].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Challenges and Opportunities in South Korea's Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, the government is pursuing ambitious plans to achieve a target of 100 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and usher in an era of 100 won per kWh generation costs [6, 7]. However, questions are being raised about the feasibility of this goal, along with calls for balanced policies between nuclear and renewable energy and the resolution of uncertainties [7, 8, 9]. In particular, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), considered a key technology for carbon neutrality, face numerous challenges, including funding shortages and supply chain issues [4]. Despite an increase in renewable energy deployment, some point out that the public perceives little change [10]. On a positive note, Samsung Electronics is accelerating efforts to achieve 100% renewable energy transition in some parts of Latin America by the first half of this year, aiming for completion by 2027 [5]. Efforts are also continuing in various regions, such as Gimhae City operating carbon-neutral experiential programs and reporting cases of revenue generation through solar REC [3, 12]. As seen in the case of South Australia, there is a positive outlook that electricity prices can plummet when renewable energy takes the lead in power supply [11].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Utilizing AI Technology for Climate Response and Guarding Against Greenwashing",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is emerging as an important tool for responding to climate change. The Gyeongbuk Agricultural Research and Extension Services plans to increase the proportion of AI technology utilization and climate change response tasks in its 2026 research projects, strengthening climate adaptation efforts in the agricultural sector [1]. However, experts maintain a critical perspective on claims that AI can solve climate problems, raising the possibility of 'greenwashing' by big tech companies [39, 45]. This suggests the need for in-depth discussions on the actual environmental impact of AI technology and its transparency, presenting the challenge of clearly distinguishing between genuine climate action and superficial efforts.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we've reviewed in today's briefing, the international community faces warnings about the climate crisis and policy challenges. Both domestically and internationally, we are at a point where we must address realistic challenges alongside expectations for renewable energy transition and the utilization of AI technology. This concludes today's climate briefing."
