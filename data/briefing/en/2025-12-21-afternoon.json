        "title": "🔴 Domestic Agriculture: Facing the Climate Crisis and Response Efforts",
        "content": "As extreme weather events such as heatwaves and torrential rains become commonplace, domestic agricultural regions like Yeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do are facing a severe climate crisis [1, 7]. Accordingly, Jeongseon County is fully responding to winter climate change, including activating emergency water supply measures in preparation for severe cold and drought [9]. Fortunately, local governments are making efforts to support farm households amidst this crisis; Yeongju City is hosting a forum on agricultural development strategies in response to climate change [5], and in Haenam, Jeollanam-do, the establishment of a Center for Climate Change Response in Agriculture and Food, and a Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center is becoming a reality [3]. Furthermore, Gochang County is actively discussing a resident-participatory model for agrivoltaics and exploring pathways for sustainable agriculture [31, 35].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating the Republic of Korea's Carbon Neutrality Implementation",
        "content": "Domestic companies and local governments are consistently pursuing their carbon-neutral initiatives. Amorepacific has demonstrated its leading role by achieving the highest rating of A in the CDP Climate Change and Water Security categories [2], and Hyundai Motor has shown its commitment to fulfilling its responsibility towards climate change by donating an IONIQ 5 to the WFP [4]. Gumi City, Yecheon County, and Gochang County were respectively recognized for their achievements in practicing carbon neutrality in daily life, receiving the Grand Prize and Excellence Awards in the Gyeongbuk Carbon Neutral Lifestyle Practice Evaluation [8, 16, 20, 21], while Cheongju City, as a leading city in resource circulation, is also accelerating its carbon-neutral activities [19]. Ansan Ecomentor and Daehan Oil Chemical, among others, are accelerating the transition to decarbonization through community-based carbon-neutral practices and process efficiency improvements [15, 22, 23].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Progress in Renewable Energy Transition and Challenges for the Industrial Sector",
        "content": "The domestic renewable energy transition is showing significant progress. Recently, reports have emerged that renewable energy generation has surpassed fossil fuel generation [25], and the Korea Expressway Corporation has successfully concluded its highway solar power project briefing session and is promoting private investment public offering projects, including new and renewable energy testbeds [24, 29, 30, 32]. The Korea Rural Community Corporation's Chungbuk Regional Headquarters also held a performance report meeting for its new renewable energy development TF, strengthening related efforts [26, 27, 28]. However, while the administration has stated that structural reorganization of the petrochemical and steel industries is inevitable and announced the promotion of a special law for renewable energy self-sufficient cities [33], automotive parts companies in the Incheon region, while recognizing the necessity of responding to carbon neutrality, are facing difficulties in actual preparation due to the burden of certification acquisition and evaluation costs required for the transition, making related support urgently needed [10, 12, 17].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 The Complexities and Warnings of Global Climate Change",
        "content": "The international community is facing warnings about the complex aspects and severity of climate change. Traces of climate change have been found in old military air samples [37], and research has also shown that chemical processes in the Arctic are accelerating global warming [42]. Climate change has already impacted Americans' incomes [38], and is affecting daily life, as seen in cases like the shortened ski season in Vancouver, Canada [47]. Along with the assessment that 2025 was a challenging year for climate change, voices criticizing the international community's inaction on the 1.5°C climate target are also growing louder [44, 46]. Meanwhile, a UN University report analyzes the multifaceted impacts of climate change, challenging the sole attribution of the Syrian civil war to climate change and pointing instead to failures in drought response governance [40]. Nevertheless, various solutions such as geospatial innovation and geoengineering are being discussed [41, 43], and possibilities for positive change are also emerging, such as the UK's Christmas being projected to have the lowest carbon intensity on record [34, 36].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has illustrated that while various domestic and international response efforts are underway amidst the climate crisis, significant challenges still persist. This is a critical juncture where sustained attention and action for climate change response are becoming even more imperative. This concludes today's climate briefing for December 21, 2025."
