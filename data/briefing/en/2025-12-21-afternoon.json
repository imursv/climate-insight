        "title": "🔴 Domestic Agriculture Facing Climate Crisis and Response Efforts",
        "content": "As extreme weather events such as heatwaves and torrential rains become commonplace, domestic agricultural regions like Yeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, are facing a severe climate crisis [1, 7]. In response, Jeongseon County is fully addressing winter climate change, including activating emergency water supply measures in preparation for severe cold and drought [9]. Fortunately, local governments are making efforts to support farming households amidst this crisis. Yeongju City is hosting a forum on agricultural development strategies for climate change response [5], and the establishment of an Agri-Food Climate Change Response Center and a Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center is becoming a reality in Haenam, Jeollanam-do [3]. Furthermore, Gochang County is actively discussing a resident-participation model for agri-voltaic systems, exploring pathways for sustainable agriculture [31, 35].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Carbon Neutrality Practices in South Korea",
        "content": "Domestic companies and local governments continue their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Amorepacific demonstrated its leading role by achieving the highest rating of 'A' in the CDP Climate Change and Water Security categories [2], while Hyundai Motor Company donated an IONIQ 5 to the WFP, showing its commitment to climate change responsibility [4]. Gumi City, Yecheon County, and Gochang County were recognized for their achievements in carbon neutrality practices, receiving top and excellence awards in the Gyeongbuk Carbon Neutrality Lifestyle Practice Evaluation [8, 16, 20, 21]. Cheongju City is also accelerating its carbon neutrality activities as a leading city in resource circulation [19]. Ansan Ecomentor and Daehan Oil Chemical, among others, are accelerating the decarbonization transition through community-based carbon neutrality practices and process efficiency improvements [15, 22, 23].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Progress in Renewable Energy Transition and Challenges for Industry",
        "content": "South Korea's renewable energy transition is showing significant progress. Recent reports indicate that renewable energy generation has surpassed fossil fuel generation [25]. Korea Expressway Corporation successfully concluded its highway solar power project briefing and is promoting private investment projects, including a new and renewable energy testbed [24, 29, 30, 32]. The Chungbuk Regional Headquarters of Korea Rural Community Corporation is also strengthening its efforts by holding a performance report meeting for its Renewable Energy New Development TF [26, 27, 28]. However, while the government and ruling party have stated that structural reorganization of the petrochemical and steel industries is inevitable and announced the promotion of a special law for renewable energy self-sufficient cities [33], automotive parts companies in the Incheon region, despite recognizing the necessity of responding to carbon neutrality, are facing difficulties in actual preparation due to the burden of certification acquisition and evaluation costs required for the transition, making related support urgently needed [10, 12, 17].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Complex Aspects and Warnings of Global Climate Change",
        "content": "The international community is facing warnings about the complex aspects and severity of climate change. Traces of climate change have been found in old military air samples [37], and research has also emerged indicating that chemical processes in the Arctic are accelerating global warming [42]. Climate change has already impacted the incomes of Americans [38] and is affecting daily life, as seen in the shortening of the ski season in Vancouver, Canada [47]. Alongside the assessment that 2025 was a challenging year for climate change, voices criticizing the international community's inaction on the 1.5°C climate target are growing louder [44, 46]. Meanwhile, a UN University report challenges the sole attribution of climate change as the cause of the Syrian civil war, pointing instead to failures in drought response governance [40], thus analyzing the impacts of climate change from various angles. Nevertheless, various solutions such as geospatial information innovation and geoengineering are being discussed [41, 43], and possibilities for positive change are also emerging, such as the UK's Christmas being projected to record its lowest carbon intensity ever [34, 36].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the diverse domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis, alongside the numerous challenges that still need to be overcome. This is a critical time when sustained attention and action for climate change response are becoming even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing for December 21, 2025."
