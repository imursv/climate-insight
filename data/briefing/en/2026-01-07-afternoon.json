        "title": "🔴 Climate Crisis: Normalized Threats and Deepening Impacts",
        "content": "Recent news reports clearly show that the climate crisis is no longer a future threat but has become a daily reality. As seen in the record for the longest tropical nights in 2025, extreme weather is already becoming normalized [9], and a serious outlook suggests that if current greenhouse gas emission levels are maintained, Pyeongtaek could experience 54.8 days of heatwaves and 44.1 days of tropical nights in 25 years [13]. This vicious cycle of climate change is increasing wildfire occurrences [5], and the domestic tangerine industry is in urgent need of cooperation and support, as farming households in the Jeonbuk region are facing significant difficulties due to heatwaves and torrential rains [17, 3, 21]. Furthermore, research indicating that the increasing rate of polar ice melt is affecting the Earth's rotation speed, even 'shaking time,' warns of the widespread impacts of the climate crisis [16]. Amidst this crisis, the assertion that 44% of the global population can mitigate climate change through dietary changes calls for fundamental shifts across our entire society [1, 12].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Climate Change Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality Efforts",
        "content": "Despite the climate crisis, various domestic entities are actively pursuing efforts for climate change adaptation and carbon neutrality. Sacheon City has established its 3rd Climate Crisis Adaptation Plan [2], and institutional responses are being strengthened, with aT establishing a 'Climate Change Response Office' to address the food climate crisis [4]. In the agricultural sector, Uiseong County is enhancing its competitiveness through climate change-responsive cultivation technologies and practical education for farmers [6, 8]. Practical technological innovations are also underway, such as the development of a specialized paint to protect fruit tree bark from cracking due to climate change, a collaboration between KCC and the Rural Development Administration [7, 15]. Moreover, the Honam National Institute of Biological Resources discovered clues to overcome climate change in 'wild oats' that survived harsh environments, suggesting the potential for nature-based solutions [10, 18]. Steps towards carbon neutrality are also continuing: Gangneung City is promoting energy welfare and carbon neutrality [31], and Youngpoong is accelerating its ESG transition through renewable energy by activating its 2050 carbon neutrality roadmap [32]. Gwangju Metropolitan City is encouraging citizen participation, ranking first nationwide in the carbon neutrality point system participation rate [36], and institutions like Namseoul University and Boryeong City are continuing efforts for carbon neutrality expert training and practice [33, 35, 38, 39].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 The Reality and Challenges of Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "The expansion of renewable energy, a core component of domestic energy transition policy, continues to present significant challenges and opportunities simultaneously. The government has set a goal to substantially increase renewable energy capacity from the current 34GW to 100GW within five years, but analyses suggest that this transition process will face many difficulties [41, 47]. Ahead of the 12th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand, the Ministry of Climate is seeking win-win solutions for nuclear power and renewable energy [45], and solutions through competition among flexible resources have been proposed to compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy [46]. Despite these challenges, positive developments are also being observed. Hwaseong City is pursuing the realization of an eco-friendly energy self-sufficient city through 'Hwaseong-style RE100' [42], and institutional flexibility is being secured, such as recognizing renewable energy produced outside buildings for achieving Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) [43]. Furthermore, a strong commitment has been expressed for the rapid promotion of renewable energy projects, including a 1.2GW floating solar project [48], and in Jeollanam-do, the process of how renewable energy-related agreements are institutionalized is being discussed [49].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response Discussions and Awareness",
        "content": "The international community is also continuing deep discussions and diverse efforts regarding climate change. In Connecticut, USA, the opinion was raised that more action on climate change is needed [53], and new concepts like the 'climate debt doom loop' are being introduced, highlighting the complex economic impacts of climate change [54]. Climate change is causing a mismatch between adaptation intentions of private forest owners in Canada and institutional support, revealing policy gaps [56], and leading to direct environmental changes such as reduced rainfall in the Southwestern United States [59]. Historically, ancient tooth analysis confirmed that climate change influenced migration during the Middle Ages [57], once again emphasizing the deep interaction between climate and human civilization. Meanwhile, while a critical perspective suggests that capitalists want the public to stop worrying about climate change [52], multi-faceted efforts are unfolding, with celebrities like Dionne Warwick, Sweetie, and Maya collaborating on climate change response [58], and new climate change funds being established [64]. The growth of the global renewable energy market is also noteworthy, with Malaysia's renewable energy sector expected to be vibrant in Q1 2024 [51].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's climate briefing highlighted the various domestic and international challenges brought about by the climate crisis, along with proactive adaptation and mitigation efforts to address them. This is a time when continuous attention and action are becoming even more crucial. This concludes the climate briefing for January 7, 2026."
