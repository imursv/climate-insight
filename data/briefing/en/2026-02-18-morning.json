        "title": "🔴 U.S.-led Climate Policy Retreat and Threats to International Cooperation",
        "content": "Clouds are gathering over international climate cooperation as the U.S. expresses the stance that 'carbon neutrality is unnecessary' and threatens to withdraw from the International Energy Agency (IEA) [1, 3, 5]. Specifically, the Trump administration is attempting to dismantle the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and terminate the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) capacity to address climate change, thereby weakening scientific research and policy foundations [9, 17, 19, 21, 29, 30]. These actions lead to decisions that contradict scientific evidence that climate change does not threaten public health [17, 19], and even raise concerns that programs assisting farmers in adapting to climate change could be lost [35]. Some analyses suggest this marks a turning point in the Republican Party's stance, defining climate change as a 'hoax' [22, 47].",

      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Direct Impacts",
        "content": "Globally, the realistic and direct impacts of the climate crisis are intensifying. In Valencia, Spain, a deadly flash flood in 2024 was amplified by human-induced climate change, with its impact range found to have expanded by 55% [15, 18, 23, 31]. Domestically, changes in fish species composition, such as 'Squid City' transforming into 'Sardine City,' have been observed, indicating impacts on ecosystems and local economies [2]. Globally, cases threatening livelihoods and public health are increasing, including sea-level rise in Hawaii, and damage to mango production in Alexandria, Egypt, and Mexico [38, 40, 45]. Crisis awareness is also spreading, with nearly half of Americans believing they will witness the catastrophic effects of climate change in their lifetime [16].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Climate Action and Innovation Efforts",
        "content": "Amidst this crisis, positive domestic and international efforts and innovations to address climate change continue. Domestically, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fisheries complex has been established in Goheung, becoming an innovation hub against the climate crisis [4]. Gyeonggi Province has successfully launched its first 'Gyeonggi Climate Satellite' and is preparing for the launch of its second and third satellites, establishing itself as a symbol of climate crisis response [6]. Regional efforts are active, with renewable energy being emphasized as a fundamental principle for the administrative integration of Jeonnam and Gwangju [8]. Internationally, Kenya is responding to climate change by establishing a national carbon credit registry [44], and in Illinois, high school students' climate change education is becoming mandatory [27], promoting awareness improvement and behavioral change through education and policy. Furthermore, companies like Crystal and EY have been recognized on the CDP A List for their climate change response efforts [49, 55], and a positive outlook suggests that the economic viability of clean energy is gradually improving [59].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Climate Change Research and Expansion of Social Discourse",
        "content": "Scientific research and social discourse on climate change are also broadly expanding. Scientists have changed their perspective on El Niño due to global warming [11], and interesting research on ecosystem adaptation methods is underway, such as findings that climate change can affect frog mating calls [14, 25] or that wolves consume bones to cope with climate change [32, 36, 37, 41, 46, 48, 52, 54]. Meanwhile, domestically, despite the approaching deadline for amending the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act, a legislative void has emerged in the National Assembly [7, 10], emphasizing the importance of political will to address the climate crisis. Climate change is being discussed as a major agenda item alongside immigration, elections, AI, and more [24]. Cultural, economic, and educational discussions across society are actively taking place, such as the Chicago Architecture and Design Film Festival opening with climate change as a sub-theme [26, 58] [34, 50, 56, 57].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the ongoing global response efforts and scientific inquiry, even amidst the severity of the climate crisis and policy setbacks in some nations. This is a time when sustained attention and proactive action on climate change become even more critical. This concludes today's climate briefing."
