        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening National Climate Crisis Adaptation and the Utilization of AI Technology",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea government has finalized the '4th National Climate Crisis Adaptation Plan' and is actively utilizing AI technology to strengthen its capacity to respond to climate disasters [1, 22, 27]. This plan includes innovation in national infrastructure such as dams and rivers, as well as the establishment of AI-based road black ice, flood, and drought forecasting systems [5, 6, 20, 28, 30]. Notably, the review of introducing 'climate insurance' for outdoor workers during heatwaves and the plan to provide a 'climate risk platform' for businesses aim to offer practical protection and enhance predictability in climate-vulnerable sectors [6, 7, 16, 18, 24, 144]. Furthermore, local-level efforts to utilize AI continue in the agricultural sector, with examples such as Wanju County protecting garlic farms with AI [2, 29], and the enactment of a special law for climate crisis response is also planned [26].",

        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality Goals",
        "content": "Domestically and internationally, various efforts to achieve carbon neutrality goals are ongoing. The Republic of Korea government announced the 'Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth Standardization Strategy 3.0,' presenting a blueprint that encompasses everything from regulatory response to a circular economy [38, 39, 54, 62, 80]. Gwangju City encouraged active citizen participation by disbursing 870 million Korean Won for greenhouse gas reduction activities through its Carbon Neutrality Point system [34, 49, 94]. Corporations and local governments are also leading the way in achieving carbon neutrality; Hyundai Glovis has obtained the highest CDP climate change rating [17], and Busan City and LG Electronics have signed an agreement to create blue carbon sinks, demonstrating concrete actions [55, 75, 77, 78, 83, 91]. Jeollanam-do is leading carbon neutrality practices by ranking first nationwide in certified low-carbon agricultural product area [42, 60, 67, 76, 79, 90], and the case of Masdar City, the world's first carbon-neutral city, is gaining attention as an eco-friendly experiment in the desert [70].",

      },
      {
        "title": "♻️ Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Challenges Ahead",
        "content": "Accelerating the transition to renewable energy is a key driver in responding to the climate crisis, with various projects and policies being pursued both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the outline of the Public Renewable Energy Act has been unveiled [97], and the Ministry of Climate is reviewing the progress of the Energy Highway initiative, accelerating towards the goal of achieving 100GW of renewable energy [130, 133]. Hyundai Engineering & Construction is participating in the Shinan Ui offshore wind power project [43, 99, 117, 122, 124, 139], and SK E&S has set a new milestone in the onshore wind sector by signing a large-scale Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Pungbaek Wind Power [111, 112, 125, 129, 131, 134, 136, 137, 138, 140, 142]. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is also strengthening policy support by establishing dedicated bureaus for rural basic income and renewable energy through organizational restructuring [106, 113, 114, 120, 126, 128], but infrastructure challenges, such as renewable energy transmission issues in the Jeollanam-do region, still remain [103]. Meanwhile, internationally, former President Trump has put a halt to offshore wind farm projects, demonstrating political hurdles to the expansion of renewable energy [119].",

      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Threats of Climate Change and International Warnings",
        "content": "Globally, the threats of climate change are intensifying, and warnings about them are growing louder. Climate disasters such as heavy rainfall and droughts are becoming increasingly extreme [23], and medical experts are warning that climate change is doubling the risk of animal-borne infectious diseases and causing an increase in vaginitis in India, with such warnings reaching 90% among medical professionals in Japan [8, 11, 165]. Nobel laureate Steven Chu likened the climate crisis to a 'Titanic' battle, urging an urgent change of course [164], and even life in remote Antarctic regions faces increased risks due to climate change [163]. Furthermore, Indonesian island residents have filed a damages lawsuit against a cement company, holding it accountable for climate change, thus elevating corporate responsibility as a legal issue [3, 15]. The UK Met Office predicts that 2025 is likely to be the hottest year on record in the UK [171, 172], demonstrating that the direct impacts of climate change are being observed in real-time [154].",

      {
        "title": "📰 Other Climate-Related Domestic and International Trends",
        "content": "Various activities are ongoing to raise awareness of climate change and explore response measures. Domestically, Paju City has concluded its climate change ecological wetland tour [14], and the Inje County Volunteer Center is conducting training for climate crisis response volunteers, thereby encouraging community participation [25]. Eco-city Siheung is presenting solutions for the era of climate crisis [4], and Pohang City is showing efforts to participate in international climate discussions, such as initiating endeavors to host the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) [10]. Meanwhile, the '2025 Seoul Startup ESG Forum' was held at Seoul Startup Hub Seongsu, where the role of businesses in sustainable growth was discussed [141], and scientists' opinions that a vegan diet is key to solving climate change were also presented [152], demonstrating a multi-faceted approach.",

    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted both the proactive domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis, as well as the escalating threats that continue to deepen. Sustained attention and cooperation are more crucial than ever to effectively respond to the unpredictability and complex impacts of climate change. This concludes today's climate briefing."
