        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening National Climate Crisis Adaptation and AI Technology Utilization",
        "content": "The South Korean government has finalized the '4th National Climate Crisis Adaptation Plan' to adapt to the climate crisis and is actively utilizing AI technology to strengthen its capacity to respond to climate disasters [1, 22, 27]. This plan includes the innovation of national infrastructure such as dams and rivers, as well as the establishment of AI-based road black ice and flood/drought forecasting systems [5, 6, 20, 28, 30]. In particular, the review of introducing 'climate insurance' for outdoor workers during heat waves and the plan to provide a 'climate risk platform' to companies aim to provide practical protection and enhance forecasting for vulnerable areas to the climate crisis [6, 7, 16, 18, 24, 144]. In addition, local-level efforts to utilize AI are continuing in the agricultural sector, such as Wanju-gun protecting garlic farming with AI [2, 29], and the enactment of a special law to respond to the climate crisis is also being promoted [26].",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality Goals",
        "content": "Various efforts are ongoing both domestically and internationally to achieve carbon neutrality goals. The South Korean government has announced the 'Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth Standardization Strategy 3.0', presenting a blueprint encompassing everything from regulatory compliance to the circular economy [38, 39, 54, 62, 80]. Gwangju City has paid 870 million won to citizens for their greenhouse gas reduction activities through the Carbon Neutrality Point system, encouraging active participation [34, 49, 94]. Companies and local governments are also taking the lead in realizing carbon neutrality, with Hyundai Glovis obtaining the highest CDP climate change rating [17], and Busan City and LG Electronics signing an agreement to create blue carbon sinks, taking concrete action [55, 75, 77, 78, 83, 91]. Jeollanam-do Province has recorded the largest area of low-carbon agricultural product certification in the country, leading the way in practicing carbon neutrality [42, 60, 67, 76, 79, 90], and the case of Masdar City, the world's first carbon-neutral city, is attracting attention as an eco-friendly experiment in the desert [70].",

      },
      {
        "title": "♻️ Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Current Challenges",
        "content": "Accelerating the transition to renewable energy is a key driver in responding to the climate crisis, and various projects and policies are being promoted both domestically and internationally. In Korea, the outline of the Public Renewable Energy Act has been revealed [97], and the Ministry of Environment is checking the progress of the energy highway project, accelerating the goal of achieving 100GW of renewable energy [130, 133]. Hyundai Engineering & Construction is participating in the Shinan Uido offshore wind power generation project [43, 99, 117, 122, 124, 139], and SK E&S has signed a large-scale direct power purchase agreement (PPA) with Pungbaek Wind Power, setting a new milestone in the onshore wind power sector [111, 112, 125, 129, 131, 134, 136, 137, 138, 140, 142]. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is also strengthening policy support by establishing a dedicated bureau for basic income and renewable energy in rural and fishing villages through organizational restructuring [106, 113, 114, 120, 126, 128], but infrastructure challenges such as the transportation of renewable energy in the Jeonnam region remain [103]. Meanwhile, internationally, former President Trump has put the brakes on offshore wind power plant projects, showing that there are political obstacles to the spread of renewable energy [119].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🔴 Intensifying Threats of Climate Change and International Warnings",
        "content": "The threat of climate change is intensifying worldwide, and warnings are growing louder. Climate disasters such as heavy rain and drought are becoming increasingly extreme [23], and medical experts in Japan are warning that climate change is doubling the risk of animal-borne infectious diseases and causing critical health effects such as increased vaginitis in India, reaching 90% [8, 11, 165]. Nobel laureate Steven Chu likened the climate crisis to a 'Titanic' battle, urging an urgent change of course [164], and even life forms in remote Antarctica are facing increased risks due to climate change [163]. In addition, residents of Indonesian islands have filed a lawsuit against a cement company seeking compensation for climate change, raising the issue of corporate responsibility as a legal dispute [3, 15]. The UK Met Office predicts that 2025 is likely to be the hottest year on record in the UK [171, 172], and the direct impacts of climate change are being observed in real-time [154].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Other Climate-Related Domestic and International Trends",
        "content": "Various activities are continuing to raise awareness of climate change and seek solutions. In Korea, Paju City has completed its climate change ecological wetland tour [14], and the Inje-gun Volunteer Center is conducting climate crisis response volunteer training, encouraging community participation [25]. The eco-city Siheung is presenting solutions for the climate crisis era [4], and Pohang City is showing movement to participate in international climate discussions by starting efforts to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) [10]. Meanwhile, the '2025 Seoul Startup ESG Forum' was held at the Seoul Startup Hub Seongsu, where the role of companies for sustainable growth was discussed [141], and scientists have suggested that vegan diets are key to solving climate change [152], indicating that multifaceted approaches are being attempted.",
