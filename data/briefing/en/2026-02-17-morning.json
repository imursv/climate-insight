      {
        "title": "🔴 Retreat in Climate Action and Political Challenges",
        "content": "News has emerged from the United States that efforts to combat climate change are experiencing a significant political setback. Former U.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed his previous stance, labeling climate change a 'hoax' [1], and the climate debate is spreading even to the judiciary, with the term 'climate change' being removed from scientific guidelines for U.S. federal judges [3]. In particular, as the Trump administration revoked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) groundbreaking climate change regulations and 'endangerment findings,' passenger car efficiency regulations have disappeared, raising concerns about increased greenhouse gas emissions [20, 26, 28, 30, 38]. Critics point out that this could pose a significant threat to U.S. leadership in climate action [22].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Climate Crisis and Wide-Ranging Impacts",
        "content": "Globally, the severe impacts of climate change are manifesting in various forms. Domestically, an emergency situation has arisen in Jeju Island due to the emergence of new and sudden pests and diseases caused by climate change [2], and internationally, researchers in Corvallis have warned that climate change could trigger a 'hothouse trajectory' [9]. Furthermore, experts have mentioned the possibility of increased sandstorms due to climate change and their earlier onset [13], and direct impacts on ecosystems are being observed, such as turtles' breeding season starting earlier but the number of breeding events decreasing by half [17]. In Cyprus, residents are being urged to reduce water consumption due to drought, and direct damage cases of climate change affecting local communities and natural landscapes have also been reported, such as a famous Italian landmark collapsing into the sea [36, 37].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Warnings and Challenges for Climate Change Preparedness",
        "content": "The international community is facing warnings about the widespread impacts of climate change and inadequate preparedness. The European Union (EU) advisory body has warned of insufficient preparedness for worsening climate change [6], and a new study estimates that Colorado residents will pay up to $37 billion due to climate change [7]. In Brazil, economic impacts are becoming a reality, with anticipated productivity losses and economic costs due to heat stress under climate change scenarios [29]. Additionally, the 'tipping risk' of Antarctic ice sheet basins due to global warming has been mapped [25], and an analysis suggests that the sustainability of the Winter Olympics is even threatened by climate change [23, 33].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts and New Approaches to Combat Climate Change",
        "content": "Amidst this crisis, positive movements and the search for new solutions to address climate change continue. Domestically, an amendment to the ordinance on carbon neutrality for natural recreation forests, proposed by Gyeonggi Provincial Council member Kim Mi-ri, has passed, strengthening regional efforts to achieve carbon neutrality [4]. Furthermore, the assetization of renewable energy is gaining momentum, from public investment to revenue generation, establishing itself as a crucial pillar of the regional circular economy [5]. Internationally, the scaling up of 'enhanced rock weathering' technology is being discussed as a potential solution for climate change mitigation [21, 27], and research is also underway on how an intersectional approach can help address climate change vulnerability [18].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Climate Change Awareness and Media Trends",
        "content": "Changes are also being observed in public awareness of climate change and the role of the media. A study revealing a 14% decrease in climate change-related media coverage in 2025 raises concerns about maintaining public interest [8]. However, the Chicago Tribune reported that an architecture and design film festival opened with climate change as its subtitle, suggesting ongoing efforts to address climate change issues in the cultural and artistic sectors [19]. Alongside an analysis that climate change is forcing us to reconsider the concepts of growth and progress, the opinion that small habits of choosing convenience over the planet exacerbate climate change has also been raised, calling for reflection on individual roles [31, 34].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has simultaneously highlighted conflicting movements regarding climate change both domestically and internationally, alongside severe warnings. Global efforts and increased awareness are more urgently needed to address the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
