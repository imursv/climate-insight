  "briefing": {
    "opening": "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. We will now commence the climate change expert spokesperson briefing for January 29, 2026. Based on the 119 climate-related news items collected today, I will provide an in-depth overview of domestic and international climate trends and key issues.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Worsening Impacts and Warnings of the Climate Crisis",
        "content": "The 'eerie' climate changes observed over the past three years suggest the potential arrival of 'unfamiliar climate change' [2], with a grim forecast indicating that if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, 41% of the world's population will live under extreme heat [4]. Domestically, concrete signs of the climate crisis are appearing, such as the collapse of Hallasan's Baengnokdam crater lake [10] and the situation where crop conversion in Jeju agriculture has become a necessity, not an option [21]. Internationally, destructive torrential rains and floods, a result of the combined effects of La Niña and climate change, have claimed dozens of lives in the Southern African region [87, 88, 89, 103, 104, 110, 111, 112, 117, 119], and scientists have confirmed that destructive landslides are occurring more frequently across Alaska [92]. Beyond these direct damages, Pacific island nations are experiencing hidden mental health costs due to climate change [105], and Nigerian farmers are reporting damage to staple crops [107], demonstrating the widespread and complex impacts of the climate crisis globally. Even cases where U.S. meteorologists reporting on climate change have received death threats [14] and instances where national park employees were instructed to delete climate change information within the parks [109] have occurred, further highlighting the severity of the climate crisis discourse. The Doomsday Clock currently stands at 85 seconds to midnight [20], identifying the climate crisis, alongside the threat of nuclear war, as a major factor imperiling human survival.",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Carbon Neutrality Transition and Domestic Response Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, multifaceted efforts to adapt to climate change and achieve carbon neutrality are gaining momentum. The Ministry of Climate is set to accelerate the launch of the NDC roadmap and K-GX, declaring 2026 as the year of carbon neutrality implementation [33, 35], and is pushing for amendments to the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act to reflect greenhouse gas reduction pathways until 2050 [44]. Domestic companies are also joining this trend; JB Financial has achieved an 'A' rating in climate change response from the global environmental information platform CDP [5, 7, 9, 18], and POSCO International has declared carbon neutrality by 2050, committing to a 37% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 [40]. Various local governments, including Gwangju City [11, 34, 36, 39, 53] and Chungnam Province [31, 42], are accelerating the achievement of carbon neutrality goals through electric vehicle purchase subsidies, and new initiatives utilizing idle facilities are continuing, such as a closed nursing home being reborn as an ESG Center, a 'carbon neutrality hub' [28, 41, 45]. Furthermore, regional climate adaptation efforts are actively underway, including the launch of a research consultative body to save 'islands' facing climate change and population decline [1, 8], and the establishment of a research cooperation system in the marine and fisheries sector [6, 24]. Meanwhile, the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center has been reorganized into the 'National Institute of Climate Science' [60, 61], raising expectations for strengthened climate science research capabilities.",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Renewable Energy Expansion and Energy Technology Innovation",
        "content": "In the renewable energy sector, a core driver for climate crisis response and carbon neutrality, government and corporate investments are expanding, and technological innovation efforts are continuing. The government is investing over 200 billion KRW [48, 57, 81] in carbon neutrality and energy transition R&D to support the development of core technologies such as next-generation solar cells and offshore wind power [78]. In particular, there is a growing recognition that expanding floating offshore wind power is essential for achieving the National Determined Contributions (NDC) and ensuring energy security [79]. Domestic companies are also actively participating in the expansion of renewable energy supply; Hyundai E&C and Topsolar have signed a cooperation agreement for the supply of 1.5 GW of renewable energy, the largest scale in Korea [73]. Furthermore, voluntary participation from the private sector is increasing, with Moderntec becoming the first in the EV charger industry to join K-RE100 and declare a 100% transition to renewable energy [76]. Institutionally, legislation for the 'publicization' of renewable energy has been initiated [62], and the 'semi-centralized dispatch operation system' for renewable energy is set to be fully implemented this spring [65], establishing a stable institutional foundation for renewable energy supply and operation. President Lee has expressed the government's strong commitment to expanding renewable energy, stating that it will lower Korea's electricity costs by supplying renewable energy in large quantities [85].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response Legislation and Policy Trends",
        "content": "The international community is strengthening legal and policy efforts to address climate change. A Dutch court has set an important precedent in climate litigation by ordering the Dutch government to protect the Caribbean island of Bonaire from climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly [86, 97, 106, 108, 115]. In the United States, Illinois lawmakers are preparing a 'Climate Change Superfund Bill' to make polluters bear the costs of climate change [91, 94], demonstrating a growing awareness of climate change responsibility. International cooperation is also strengthening; global transparency efforts are accelerating [113], and various international organizations and experts are collaborating to address climate change and CBRN risks [116]. Meanwhile, agriculture, as both a victim and contributor to climate change, has been shown through research to be able to reverse these trends through plant breeding [90]. However, not all movements are positive. In Florida, a bill limiting local government climate change response efforts passed a Senate committee [101], and attempts to reverse climate action are observed in some regions, similar to the past Trump administration's efforts to roll back climate change policies [98].",

    ],
    "closing": "As you have seen in today's briefing, the climate crisis is having severe global impacts, but simultaneously, innovative efforts and policy advancements to overcome it are actively underway both domestically and internationally. I reiterate that only sustained interest and participation can secure our collective future, and with that, I conclude today's climate briefing."
