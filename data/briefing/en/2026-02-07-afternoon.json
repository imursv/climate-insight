        "title": "🔴 The Paradox of Climate Change and the Crisis of Winter Sports",
        "content": "Despite ongoing global warming, some regions are experiencing extreme cold during winter, leading to a widespread perception that 'winter is broken' [1, 4]. This climate change severely threatens the future of the Winter Olympics [25, 26, 29], with the UN even warning of the potential depletion of Winter Olympic venues [33]. Indeed, at Rhode Island's only ski resort, the ski season is becoming increasingly difficult and uncertain due to climate change [30], accelerating discussions about the future format of the Winter Olympics and Paralympics [29, 34]. Furthermore, Indian cities are also expected to warm faster due to climate change [35].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Carbon Neutrality Policies and Strengthening Governance Initiatives",
        "content": "Domestically, public discourse on the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act has begun, three weeks ahead of its amendment deadline [8]. Asan City Council's Special Committee on Carbon Neutrality adopted its activity report and concluded its operations [9]. However, an analysis of local government carbon neutrality master plans reveals significant implementation gaps, raising concerns [20]. Internationally, lawyers in Pennsylvania are advocating for greenhouse gas reduction measures [27], and discussions continue regarding the impact of President Trump on international climate action [28].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Carbon Neutrality Practices and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "Various efforts and innovations for carbon neutrality are underway both domestically and internationally. Jeollanam-do Province is fully committed to attracting the 'Marine and Fisheries Climate Change Response Center' [3], and Pocheon City is promoting ginseng cultivation education in response to climate change [5]. An organization named 'Climate Future' has launched, announcing its ambition to lead carbon neutrality with future generations and innovative technologies [6, 11]. Several local governments, including Seongbuk-gu, Paju City, and Chungnam Province, are operating carbon neutrality practice groups [7], providing rewards for daily life practices [12, 15], and leading carbon neutrality efforts through senior resource circulation guardians [13, 15]. Notably, Busan's Yeongdo-gu achieved the highest 'A grade' in the national local government carbon neutrality plan evaluation [16, 17, 18]. In the industrial sector, Nippon Steel is accelerating carbon neutrality by introducing new electric arc furnaces in Setouchi [10, 14]. Enerdot is creating a sustainable ecosystem with optimized renewable energy resource management solutions [22], and Shinhan Bank and Hanwha Solutions are strengthening financial cooperation in the U.S. solar power and North American renewable energy sectors [23]. In Gurye County, the preparatory committee for the 2026 Carbon Neutral Soil Revitalization Expo was held [21].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ The Dual Nature of Energy Transition and Social Impacts",
        "content": "Despite active development in renewable energy, there are concerning reports that global fossil fuel emissions continue to rise [24]. This climate change, coupled with low birth rates and an aging population, is altering the nature of disaster situations, and there are emerging efforts to respond with AI [2]. Amidst the growing recognition that carbon neutrality is essential for survival [19], climate change is also having direct economic impacts on daily life, such as increasing chocolate prices [32].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has clearly illustrated the complex impacts of climate change, the diverse efforts being made to address them, and the challenges that still persist. This concludes the climate briefing for February 7, 2026."
