      {
        "title": "🔴 Intensifying Warning Signs of Climate Change",
        "content": "News received today once again reminds us of the severe impacts of climate change on ecosystems and society as a whole. The phenomenon of Antarctic penguins' breeding season rapidly advancing is interpreted as a warning sign for the ecosystem [1, 26, 170, 175, 182, 194]. Domestically, concerns have been raised that heatwaves could last for 100 days or that winter might disappear [14]. Furthermore, alongside analyses suggesting that price increases for essential food ingredients such as coffee, cocoa, and olives may be due to climate change [7], international warnings have also emerged that climate change disproportionately affects the poor [179]. Historical examples of large-scale wildfires and soil erosion caused by global warming 56 million years ago, coupled with the increased likelihood of extreme wildfires today, demonstrate that the current climate crisis is a present issue, not a future one [184, 186]. Even questions about sharks' teeth weakening have been raised [187], underscoring the need for close monitoring of changes across the entire ecosystem.",

      {
        "title": "⚠️ South Korea's Carbon Neutrality Transition: Opportunities and Challenges",
        "content": "While global efforts to address the climate crisis are expanding, with carbon neutrality investments increasing fivefold over the past decade [33, 41, 167], an analysis indicates that South Korea faces an 'investment cliff' due to a concentration of investment in manufacturing [33, 41, 167]. This is identified as a major reason why South Korean companies struggle to procure renewable energy, with research showing the scale of this difficulty to be 3.5 times greater than in the United States [91, 139, 146]. Questions have also been raised about the sufficiency of current carbon neutrality education [46], suggesting an urgent need for qualitative improvements in both education and investment. Meanwhile, Jeju agriculture shows mixed results depending on climate change response methods [4], highlighting the importance of region-specific strategies.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Carbon Neutrality Efforts by Domestic Companies and Local Governments",
        "content": "Despite these challenges, domestic companies and local governments continue their efforts towards carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition. SK Square and LS Cable & System have demonstrated their ESG management capabilities by achieving the highest rating, 'Leadership A,' in the CDP Climate Change Response assessment [3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 31, 32]. Notably, Hyundai Engineering & Construction is leading the achievement of K-RE100 by securing South Korea's largest renewable energy supply chain of 1.5 GW in cooperation with Topsolar [45, 80, 92, 95, 97, 101, 103, 105, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 126, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135, 137, 138, 142, 143, 145, 147, 148, 149, 150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 165, 166]. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy plans to support companies with up to 5 billion KRW each by introducing a carbon-neutral facility investment auction system for cost-effective greenhouse gas reduction [34, 49, 51, 55, 68, 72]. Furthermore, various local governments, including Yecheon-gun and Yangpyeong-gun, are investing substantial budgets in environmental policies to foster carbon-neutral leading cities [38, 43, 47, 48, 50, 53, 59, 62, 64, 67, 71, 74, 75, 77, 79]. Community-based financial institutions such as Nonghyup, Suhyup, Shinhyup, and Saemaul Geumgo have also been added as handling agencies for renewable energy policy loans [86, 99, 124, 129, 144, 156, 159, 164, 169], expected to contribute to the wider adoption of renewable energy.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Change Response and Research Efforts",
        "content": "The international community continues its multifaceted efforts to address climate change. China showed remarkable changes in energy transition last year, with its annual fossil fuel power generation decreasing for the first time in a decade and the share of renewable energy surging [104, 117, 134]. Tajikistan is expanding saxaul plantations to combat climate change [177], and insights from small-scale farmers in Ghana on adapting to climate change were also discussed [185]. Furthermore, meta-research has revealed adaptation mechanisms animals employ to cope with climate change [173], and a new framework for assessing the resilience of agroecosystems has been proposed [180]. Environment and Climate Change Canada has released a draft Federal Sustainable Development Strategy to be applied from 2026 to 2029 and is currently soliciting feedback [191]. International discussions are also actively underway on how climate change education can move beyond discourse and despair [172].",

    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted both the threats of climate change and the diverse domestic and international efforts to overcome them. We must continue to build a better future through sustained attention and action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
