        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Today, proactive and multifaceted efforts to address climate change were actively reported domestically. Suncheon City in Jeollanam-do announced its strategy to promote an RE-100 industrial complex, and Gwangju Metropolitan City hosted the nation's first 'Climate Crisis Response Citizens' Assembly,' encouraging community participation [1, 4]. Gyeonggi Province is playing a leading role in carbon neutrality, RE100, and climate insurance, while Hankook Tire received an A rating from CDP for two consecutive years in recognition of its excellence in climate change response [3, 5]. Furthermore, news of KEPCO KPS's support for creating 'carbon-neutral villages' and the Chung Mong-Koo Foundation's Presidential Commendation for carbon neutrality emphasize the social responsibility of corporations and foundations. Efforts such as Jeollanam-do and Korea Development Bank's establishment of a renewable energy development system, and H-Energy's B2C platform strategy, are raising expectations for accelerating the transition to renewable energy [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Intensifying Climate Crisis Impacts and Complex Challenges",
        "content": "Meanwhile, the severity of the climate crisis and its complex challenges also garnered attention. Winter climates are changing due to warming, and extreme weather events are becoming commonplace, with this year's hurricane season cited as one example of climate change [15, 18]. In particular, direct impacts on ecosystems and natural environments, such as the disappearance of wetland habitats in Sussex, UK, and the worsening drought in the Colorado River basin, are being likened to 'canaries in a coal mine,' sounding an alarm [21, 22]. Even symbolic reports that Santa Claus had to cancel global deliveries due to climate change, and the concerns of Christmas tree farmers, illustrate the pervasive impact of climate change on our lives [23, 30]. Amidst these circumstances, dubious claims from 'fake scientists' promoting 'climate crisis denial' or concerns that certain political statements could hinder the renewable energy transition have also been raised, calling for heightened social vigilance [2, 16, 33].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Policies and Adaptation Strategies",
        "content": "In the international community, various policies and adaptation strategies are being pursued to address climate change. In Hawaii, a new climate change tax on cruise passengers was upheld by a federal ruling, drawing attention to new attempts to secure climate financing [17, 27, 28, 32]. Furthermore, the search for practical solutions is active, including scientists' efforts to save the chocolate industry from climate change, and the presentation of surprisingly simple yet effective climate adaptation methods [24, 29]. Nature-based solutions and corporate carbon neutrality efforts are also continuing, such as Japan's tree-planting technology aiding urban climate change response, and SAAM Towage's Brazilian operations achieving carbon-neutral certification [34, 36]. The optimistic attitude of North Carolina Christmas tree farmers, who suffered from Hurricane Helen last year, towards rebuilding demonstrates the importance of resilience and adaptation to climate disasters [37].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Perception and Social Discourse on Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change is emerging as a crucial topic that transcends mere environmental issues, shaping overall societal perception and discourse. In the era of carbon neutrality, new challenges are arising in land, infrastructure, and transport legislation, and calls for a shift in our mindset regarding the climate crisis are growing louder [7, 19]. Research suggesting that polar bears may evolve in response to climate change indicates the adaptability of species, but also highlights the rapid pace of change [20]. In the United States, perceptions are being shaped by a complex interplay of skepticism, dogmatism, and personal experience regarding climate change, and interest from various segments of society is increasing, with youth in Swindon, UK, actively expressing their views on climate change response [25, 31]. The fact that the best books in the environment and climate change sector for 2025 ask 'what it means to live on a damaged planet' demonstrates that climate change is expanding into an ontological question for humanity [35].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing served as an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of societal awareness regarding the intensifying crisis, alongside the diverse domestic and international efforts to address climate change. This concludes the climate briefing for December 24, 2025."
