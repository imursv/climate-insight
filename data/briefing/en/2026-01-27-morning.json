    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Response and Carbon Neutrality Implementation",
        "content": "Domestic companies and local governments are continuing their efforts to respond to climate change and achieve carbon neutrality goals [1, 2]. Hyundai Steel has demonstrated its leading position by achieving 'Leadership A-', the highest rating among domestic steel companies in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change response assessment [1, 3, 5]. Local community efforts are active, with Gangneung City strengthening its tap water supply system to proactively respond to drought risks, and Jeollanam-do promoting the improvement of agricultural production infrastructure to address climate change [2, 6]. Particularly in the agricultural sector, the Rural Development Administration emphasizes innovation in agricultural management through an AI transformation, and an RE100 case has emerged where Jeju tangerines are produced with 100% renewable energy, demonstrating carbon neutrality in practice [4, 8, 16, 17, 23]. Alongside this, efforts to accelerate carbon neutrality are continuing in various sectors, including Jeju Province's promotion of carbon-neutral architecture, Changwon City's introduction of electric vehicle conversion subsidies, and Yeosu City's continued operation of the carbon neutrality point system. Gyeonggi Province is also supporting eco-friendly farms affected by heatwaves with crop restoration costs, combining efforts for climate change adaptation [7, 10, 13, 14].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Energy Policy Transition and Challenges",
        "content": "Domestic energy policy is facing a significant transition, seeking harmony between renewable energy and nuclear power generation [27]. As the perception spreads that renewable energy alone cannot cope with the surge in electricity demand due to AI technology development, this government has confirmed the construction of two new nuclear power plants and officially abolished the nuclear phase-out policy [11, 15, 20, 28]. This simultaneous expansion policy for renewable energy and nuclear power raises questions about electricity tariffs and the entities responsible for cost burdens [22]. Nevertheless, energy public enterprises can receive positive evaluations in management assessments through the expansion of renewable energy [18], and indeed, KEPCO KPS and Jeonnam Development Corporation are strengthening business development cooperation for a major renewable energy transition in the Jeonnam region [19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Meanwhile, active discussions are also underway regarding whether the 100GW renewable energy decarbonization declaration is a prepared transition or a race against time, and communication with related industries, such as holding meetings with wind power industry stakeholders, is ongoing [26, 34].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Widespread Impacts",
        "content": "Globally, the climate crisis is manifesting widespread impacts, accompanied by scientists' warnings that it could worsen faster than expected [60]. Human-induced climate change is fueling larger wildfires [35], and Victoria, Australia, has faced bushfire risks due to record-breaking heatwaves [63]. The 'monster' winter storm that occurred in January 2026 also highlighted the role of climate change, including warmer oceans and increased moisture, presented as evidence that climate change is real [47, 54]. In polar regions, thawing frozen ecosystems are causing microorganisms to impact climate change [37], and a new perspective suggests that urban subsidence could pose a greater climate crisis than sea-level rise [36]. Furthermore, climate change is causing various problems across society, including difficulties in reservoir management, harm to Kenyan women working in coastal tourism, and the unusual situation of Swiss dog races being held on grass [38, 42, 43, 56, 59]. It is also causing billions of dollars in economic losses in Colorado, and the EU is expected to face annual costs of 70 billion euros for climate change adaptation by 2050 [44, 51]. According to new research, the number of people exposed to extreme heat is projected to more than double by 2050, raising growing concerns [64].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Response, Cooperation, and Political Barriers",
        "content": "The international community continues its cooperation and efforts to address climate change, but political barriers also persist. SEforALL mobilized global action to achieve SDG7 on Clean Energy Day, and European nations strengthened their commitment to 100GW of wind power generation [49, 65]. Climate change is fostering cooperation between rural and urban communities in Kentucky [39], and a particular island governor emphasized that his island could serve as a model for climate change response [58]. Meanwhile, some political leaders have expressed negative stances, questioning climate change concerns based on extreme cold and winter storms [53, 55], but media outlets like CNN are inviting climate scientists to explain that such claims do not disprove global warming [52]. Cases of ignoring climate change risks have also been reported, such as Zambia and Zimbabwe proceeding with hydropower projects on the drying Zambezi River, indicating the importance of international policy coordination [57]. Furthermore, policy discussions and research are actively underway, with President Lai presiding over the National Climate Change Committee, and a global gridded dataset for heating and cooling degree days under climate change scenarios being released [41, 50].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the multifaceted domestic and international efforts to address climate change, the reality of the deepening climate crisis, and the complex discussions surrounding energy transition. It was a day that once again underscored the urgency and importance of climate action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
