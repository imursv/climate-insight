        "title": "🔴 Climate Crisis: Warnings on Tipping Points and New Risks",
        "content": "Today's briefing begins with a warning about the severity of the climate crisis and the new challenges we face. A strong warning from the scientific community has once again been raised: if carbon neutrality targets are delayed, the Earth's climate tipping points could be surpassed [2, 11]. In particular, the unchecked expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers is depleting drinking water resources, which are already diminishing due to climate change, and is being identified as a new climate risk. Research has also shown that global warming is accelerating the decomposition of major greenhouse gases [5, 14, 149]. Furthermore, the scientific community emphasizes that achieving carbon neutrality alone may not fully resolve the climate crisis. A report suggests that the Paris Agreement has not effectively driven the decarbonization of the automotive industry, alongside challenges faced by the construction sector, and the potential relaxation of internal combustion engine vehicle regulations by the European Union could significantly reduce the proportion of electric vehicles by 2035, indicating the need for fundamental change [6, 10, 43, 140]. Additionally, the construction of new coal-fired power plants in China is projected to reach an all-time high in 2025, raising international concerns as the climate deadline approaches [165].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Carbon Neutrality Efforts and Progress in Local Governments and Industries",
        "content": "Despite these warnings, various efforts towards carbon neutrality are continuing domestically. The youth climate change organization GEYK and the European Union successfully hosted the '3rd Youth Biodiversity Forum,' encouraging the participation of future generations [1, 8]. The National Assembly's Special Committee on Climate has launched a public discussion committee to revise the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality, thereby strengthening the legal foundation [32, 46]. Several local governments, including Gimcheon City, Buyeo County, and Yangpyeong County, are reorganizing their climate change response organizations, discussing the introduction of rural climate response direct payment systems, and establishing farmer education and adaptation measures, thereby strengthening regional response capabilities [3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18]. Particularly noteworthy is the news that Hyundai Steel has begun mass production of 'HyECOSTEEL,' a carbon-reduced steel plate that cuts carbon emissions by 20% for the first time in the world, thereby strengthening its core capabilities in supplying carbon-neutral materials [25, 39, 44, 47, 48, 51, 55, 57, 141]. Concurrently, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is expanding commercialization support for carbon-neutral technologies to enter the market [38, 59, 63]. Comprehensive efforts are also underway, including recruitment for Seoul City's Eco-Mileage system, expanded distribution of electric and hydrogen vehicles in Gyeongju City and Gumi City, and carbon neutrality campaigns by the Gwangju City Council [31, 34, 35, 36, 40, 49, 61, 62].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Building Distributed Energy Systems",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy and the establishment of distributed energy systems are emerging as key pillars in responding to the climate crisis. The government has paved the way for RE100 implementation by allowing data centers using distributed energy to directly purchase renewable energy [65, 70, 71, 72, 90, 107, 130, 131]. Global companies are also active, with Google, for example, acquiring renewable energy generators to secure power for its data centers [86]. Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) has successfully secured project financing worth $500 million for a renewable energy power project in Guam, USA, signaling a green light for expanding its overseas renewable energy business [68, 80, 84, 89, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 103, 106, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 132, 133, 135, 137, 138, 139]. Furthermore, Korea Western Power is accelerating its major transition into renewable energy and AI sectors, dedicating all its efforts to securing future competitiveness [67, 69, 74, 77, 82, 87, 88, 93, 95, 101, 104, 108, 115]. Efforts such as mandatory solar power in public parking lots, allowing power trading for electric vehicle batteries, and Gyeongsangbuk-do Province and Inje County's initiatives to expand renewable energy supply are also continuing [75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 83, 85, 91, 92, 102, 110, 120, 126, 127, 134, 136]. These movements are expected to accelerate further, coupled with the outlook that green hydrogen is being called 'new oil' and is changing the landscape of the renewable energy market [73, 128].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Impacts of Climate Change and Response Research",
        "content": "The international community is exploring the widespread impacts of climate change and various response measures. The Washington Post highlighted that climate change is making it increasingly difficult to host the Winter Olympics, addressing its impact on the sports sector [143, 153]. Additionally, the Sierra Club reported that climate change is reshaping chocolate prices and ingredients, emphasizing its impact on daily life [146]. Sediment records suggest that tropical land regions could become nearly twice as hot as oceans due to climate change, warning of the vulnerability of specific areas [156]. An Eco-Business report mentioned the potential for 500,000 'additional' malaria deaths in Africa by 2050 due to climate change, foreshadowing a severe crisis in the health sector [158]. Amidst this, researchers from Lehigh University and the Salk Institute are proposing solutions through science and technology, suggesting new approaches to address climate change risks and research into developing drought-resistant crops, respectively [151, 152]. A report indicating that Americans are more concerned about climate change than generally perceived shows a positive shift in public awareness [147]. International cooperation and research are actively underway, with the Egyptian Prime Minister ordering the acceleration of coastal protection projects to combat climate change [164], and discussions taking place at the IMO-UNEP Innovation Forum to address climate change in the maritime sector [157], among other initiatives [144, 145, 154, 159, 163].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the urgency of the climate crisis and the diverse response efforts being made both domestically and internationally. It will be crucial to overcome the climate crisis through continuous scientific research, technological innovation, and international cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
