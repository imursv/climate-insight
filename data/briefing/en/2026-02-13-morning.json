        "title": "🔴 Significant Rollback of US Climate Policy",
        "content": "According to major news released today, the US Trump administration has taken steps to nullify the government's authority to address climate change by repealing the 'endangerment finding' regulation, a core basis for greenhouse gas emissions control [6, 7, 72, 74]. This action withdraws the scientific findings and policy judgments of the Obama era, which linked greenhouse gases to climate change, and is being assessed as the 'greatest policy regression in US climate change response history' [76, 78, 85, 93, 107]. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stripped itself of its authority to regulate emissions, which is expected to significantly relax emission standards for major industries such as automobiles [8, 75, 79]. The scientific community is raising strong criticism against the Trump administration's decision to call climate change a 'hoax,' despite clear evidence that it threatens public health [77, 97, 103, 111]. Concerns are also being raised that such deregulation could lead to a massive volume of climate change-related lawsuits in the future [81, 119].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Expansion of Domestic Climate Change Legislation and Carbon Neutrality Efforts",
        "content": "In the Republic of Korea, positive developments have been observed with the strengthening of the legal framework for climate change response and the expansion of local government efforts towards carbon neutrality. Notably, amendments to the Meteorological Act and the Climate Change Monitoring and Prediction Act have passed the National Assembly, expected to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts and strengthen climate change monitoring capabilities [1, 2, 5]. Goyang City has achieved the highest compliance rating certification from the global climate compact GCoM, and numerous local governments, including Boryeong City, Haenam County, and Gwangmyeong City, are actively pursuing carbon neutrality through initiatives such as RE100 declarations, groundbreaking ceremonies for carbon neutrality education centers, and home repair support [10, 12, 13, 15]. Furthermore, the Korea Environment Corporation is leading the K-RE100 initiative for public institutions, while carbon neutrality support centers, related forums, and projects are actively being implemented across the nation in areas such as Chuncheon City, Sangju City, Hoseo University, Seongnam City, and Changwon Special City [14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24]. These domestic legislative actions and community-level practices will serve as a crucial foundation for presenting solutions for national energy strategy in an era of climate crisis and accelerating the transition to a carbon-neutral society [4, 17].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Active Domestic Policies and Industrial Investments for Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Domestic policies and industrial investments for expanding renewable energy supply are actively underway. Notably, eight bills, including the Renewable Energy Act, which contains provisions to relax setback distance regulations for solar and wind power generation facilities, have passed the National Assembly. This has resolved the 'rubber band regulations' that varied by local government, laying the groundwork for renewable energy expansion [28, 36, 39, 44, 45, 46, 49, 51, 57, 58, 60, 63, 64]. Concurrently, SK Group is strengthening its position in the renewable energy market through large-scale investments, including pursuing the integration of its new and renewable energy businesses and considering the establishment of a joint venture with global investment firm KKR [25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 37, 38, 42, 47, 50, 56, 61, 65, 67, 71]. A plan to increase the renewable energy usage ratio for public institutions to 60% by 2030 has been announced, and various entities are accelerating the renewable energy transition, such as KOSPO's efforts to achieve RE100, Ulsan City's resident-participatory 'Haetbitmasil' (sunshine village) project, and KEPCO KDN's energy ICT cooperation with Senegal [29, 30, 41, 48, 55, 68]. Furthermore, the Gwangju Metropolitan City Council is emphasizing the mandatory 100% renewable energy use for data centers as a critical task, responding to the increasing demand for renewable energy linked to the AI industry [69, 70].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ International Impacts and New Challenges of Climate Change",
        "content": "Internationally, climate change is exerting global impacts in various forms, presenting new challenges. Globally, 3,100 glacier surges are being tracked [90], increased agricultural water usage in Central Asia is linked to climate change [101], and research results have been published associating the decline in Southern Right Whale reproductive rates with climate change [109]. Portugal is experiencing direct damage from extreme weather events, such as successive deadly storms, prompting calls for adaptation to a climate emergency [120]. Meanwhile, analyses suggest that climate change is reshaping the global plastic pollution crisis [108], and concerns are emerging that the proliferation of data centers could threaten the achievement of net-zero targets [117]. Amidst these circumstances, the Taiwanese government is 'sincerely' committed to renewable energy [35], and some countries are showing movements to strengthen climate action, such as the New Zealand Supreme Court ruling that climate change must be mandatorily considered in petroleum exploration permit bids [116]. However, critical opinions have also been raised domestically regarding the hasty pursuit of new nuclear power plant construction while neglecting renewable energy, indicating a need for careful deliberation on the direction of energy transition policies [34].",
        "tone": "warning"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has clearly illustrated the contrasting trends within the international community regarding climate change response, alongside continuous domestic efforts. Deep concerns persist regarding the impact of the US policy rollback on global climate action, making this a critical juncture where domestic legislative efforts and renewable energy expansion become even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
