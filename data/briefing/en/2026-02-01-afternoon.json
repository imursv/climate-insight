        "title": "⚠️ Policy Dilemmas and Legal Challenges: The Reality of Climate Action",
        "content": "Japanese political parties, ahead of the general election, have expressed the need for active responses to climate change, yet simultaneously put forth the dilemma-ridden argument that the phase-out of coal-fired power generation should be gradual [1, 5, 47]. Domestically, public discourse has begun as the deadline for amending the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act, which was ruled 'unconstitutional,' approaches, highlighting the urgent task of strengthening the legal foundation of climate policy [8]. Internationally, critical views have also been raised, suggesting that 'net-zero' policies are inhumane and make people sad, underscoring the importance of social consensus and realistic approaches to achieving climate goals [49].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Carbon Neutrality Practices Spreading Nationwide: Cooperation and Innovation",
        "content": "Domestically, efforts across various sectors for carbon neutrality are actively underway. LG Uplus has strengthened its responsible corporate role by signing a renewable energy contract with GS E&C to achieve carbon neutrality for data centers [9]. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is promoting the expansion of carbon neutrality in public catering by introducing low-carbon certified livestock products into military meals [11, 13], and Jeonbuk Self-Governing Province is strengthening carbon reduction efforts in daily life, such as significantly expanding support for the use of multi-use containers [18]. At the local government level, innovative attempts for the carbon-neutral transition of local communities are continuing, with Buyeo County proposing a Daejeon-Chungnam mega-regional carbon neutrality model [12], and Changwon Special City launching its data-driven 'Carbon Neutrality Platform' for the first time [16, 19, 22, 26].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 100GW Renewable Energy Target and Power Grid Transformation",
        "content": "The Ministry of Climate (Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment) plans to dedicate all its efforts to achieving the 100GW renewable energy supply target by 2030, designating this year as the first year of a major energy transition, focusing on power grid expansion and operational innovation [23, 28, 32, 33, 37, 38, 40]. To this end, various organizations, including Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, Daegu Regional Environmental Office, and Nakdong River Basin Environmental Office, are launching MOUs and consultative bodies to expand renewable energy supply, thereby solidifying regional cooperation systems [25, 31, 34, 35, 36, 39, 43, 46]. In particular, in line with the 100GW renewable energy target, the government plans to actively encourage the use of renewable energy such as solar power by restructuring industrial electricity rates to be lower during the day and higher at night [29, 41, 42, 44, 45].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Climate Change Adaptation and International Challenges: From Education to New Technologies",
        "content": "Alongside international efforts to address climate change, diverse approaches both domestically and internationally are drawing attention. Domestically, Yongin City is contributing to fostering environmental awareness among future generations by operating climate change experience programs for elementary school students during the winter break [2, 3, 7], and Yeosu City has been selected as the host city for the 2026 UNFCCC Climate Week, planning to establish a venue for international climate discussions [4]. Internationally, climate change is reshaping corporate business models [50], and Saudi Arabia, as part of its 'Vision 2030,' is emphasizing the role of renewable energy in climate change mitigation [52], among other nations exploring response strategies tailored to their specific circumstances. However, unexpected complexities and dangerous ideas are also emerging in the process of responding to the climate crisis, such as China's renewable energy industry facing new challenges [30], and even 'absurd plans' like detonating nuclear bombs underwater 'to save the Earth' being mentioned [53].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As discussed in today's briefing, climate change response continues through the active practices and innovative efforts of various domestic and international stakeholders, even amidst policy dilemmas and legal challenges. In particular, the expansion of renewable energy and the restructuring of the power grid will be key drivers in accelerating our society's transition to carbon neutrality. This concludes today's climate briefing. Thank you."
