      {
        "title": "🔴 Intensifying climate crisis and domestic and international warnings",
        "content": "News reports released today clearly demonstrate that the climate crisis is intensifying both domestically and internationally. Jeju tourism is facing a climate change crisis [1, 4], and the surge in prices for yellowtail, a popular winter delicacy ('national sashimi'), is also analyzed as an impact of climate change [3]. Domestically, new 'severe heatwave alerts' and 'tropical night advisories' have been established, and disaster text messages for torrential rainfall began to be sent out from May [2, 93], indicating a growing awareness of the severity of the climate crisis. The climate crisis is threatening food security [10, 126], and internationally, warnings have also emerged that climate change threatens Christmas foods [110]. The UK Met Office predicts that global temperatures will rise by more than 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2026 [125], and analysis suggests that Hurricane Helen's deadly rain and winds were also intensified by climate change [120].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Policies and Corporate Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Even amidst these crises, legislative and policy efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are active domestically. Jointly by both ruling and opposition parties, the 'Clean Heat Energy Act' has been proposed [5, 13]. Furthermore, in the National Assembly's Special Committee on Climate Change, a subcommittee for reviewing the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act is underway, and the framework act has been passed [20, 34, 38, 42], thus accelerating the establishment of an institutional foundation. Local governments are also encouraging the practice of carbon neutrality. Jeonju City provides carbon neutrality point incentives [15, 26, 31], Eunpyeong-gu holds resident participation performance-sharing events [17, 25], and Goheung County aims for 'Carbon Neutral Clean Goheung' by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles [32, 39]. Efforts by corporations to respond to climate change also continue. Woori Financial Group and Hyundai Glovis achieved leadership and top ratings in the global CDP assessment [7, 12], setting an example for ESG management. Furthermore, measures for achieving carbon neutrality were discussed at the South Chungcheong Province Public Architects' meeting [22], and the nation's first wooden apartment building was constructed in Gaewoonsan Village, Jongam-dong, presenting a carbon-neutral housing alternative [33], demonstrating that the practice of carbon neutrality is becoming visible in various sectors [43].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷⚠️ Renewable Energy Expansion and Pressing Challenges",
        "content": "The government has set a target of supplying 100GW of renewable energy by 2030 [61, 78, 104, 105], accelerating the transition to a decarbonized civilization. To this end, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) is enhancing power generation predictability by providing customized meteorological services for renewable energy and 'solar radiation and wind speed prediction' information [11, 54, 67, 89]. Daegu City and Gyeongsangnam-do Province are expanding support for new and renewable energy housing projects and agricultural facility support [62, 68, 70, 86, 96], contributing to the community-based spread of renewable energy. However, various challenges and controversies have also arisen during the expansion of renewable energy. Three major challenges hidden behind the 'rosy figures' of the 100GW renewable energy era have been mentioned [75]. Furthermore, public perception indicates that over 60% consider the issue of fake news, such as 'heavy metal-laden solar panels,' to be serious [59, 63, 64, 82], highlighting the importance of fact-checking platforms. In particular, civil society criticized the Jeju Provincial Council's approval of a gas power plant proposal as a declaration of abandoning carbon neutrality [98]. Field difficulties were also reported, such as criticisms that Hwasun County's resident-participatory new and renewable energy project, while having a system in place, lacks detailed planning [103]. Furthermore, areas requiring policy and social consensus remain, including the urban gas industry's rebuttal regarding the recognition of air-source heat pumps as renewable energy [73] and the question of 'who will own it' during the public renewable energy legislation process [72, 80].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 The international community's climate response and new research trends",
        "content": "The international community is confronting new scientific realities alongside various efforts to address climate change. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) commended Pacific students who led the advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on climate change [112], acknowledging the contributions of the younger generation. UN Climate Change is resuming efforts to strengthen the NAZCA portal for non-state climate action [118], emphasizing the importance of multilateral cooperation, while Malaysia has set a goal to transition from 'nation-building' to 'carbon neutrality' [124]. Meanwhile, new research findings have raised the possibility that hydrogen could contribute to global warming [121], suggesting the need for an in-depth review of energy transition technologies. Research from the University of Arizona demonstrates changes in income due to climate change [122], broadening the understanding of climate change's impact on socioeconomic structures. In Japan, a group of citizen plaintiffs filed the first climate lawsuit questioning the state's responsibility for climate change [107, 111], sparking international discussions on climate accountability. Alongside these international efforts, there is a growing call for more aggressive policies to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius after COP30 [109].",

    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we examined the severity of the climate crisis, various domestic and international efforts to combat it, and the challenges encountered during the expansion of renewable energy. This is a critical juncture where sustained attention and concrete action on climate change are becoming even more vital. This concludes today's climate briefing."
