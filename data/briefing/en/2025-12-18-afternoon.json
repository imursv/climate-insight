        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and Domestic and International Warnings",
        "content": "News reports released today clearly demonstrate the deepening climate crisis both domestically and internationally. Jeju tourism is facing a climate change crisis [1, 4], and the soaring prices of yellowtail, a 'national favorite' sashimi in winter, are also analyzed as an impact of climate change [3]. Domestically, awareness of the severity of the climate crisis is increasing, with the establishment of 'severe heatwave warnings' and 'tropical night advisories,' and the dispatch of disaster text messages for torrential rainfall beginning in May [2, 93]. The climate crisis is threatening food security [10, 126], and internationally, warnings have emerged that climate change threatens Christmas foods [110]. The UK Met Office predicts that global temperatures in 2026 will rise by more than 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels [125], and an analysis suggests that Hurricane Helen's deadly rain and winds were also intensified by climate change [120].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Policies and Corporate Efforts Towards Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Amidst this crisis, legislative and policy efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are active domestically. The 'Clean Thermal Energy Act' has been jointly proposed by both ruling and opposition parties [5, 13], and the National Assembly's Special Committee on Climate is accelerating the establishment of an institutional foundation, with a subcommittee reviewing the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act and the act being passed [20, 34, 38, 42]. Local governments are also encouraging carbon neutrality practices; Jeonju City is providing carbon neutrality point incentives [15, 26, 31], Eunpyeong-gu is holding a resident participation performance-sharing event [17, 25], and Goheung County aims for 'Carbon-Neutral Clean Goheung' by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles [32, 39]. Corporate efforts to address climate change also continue, with Woori Financial Group and Hyundai Glovis achieving leadership and top ratings in the global CDP assessment [7, 12], setting an example for ESG management. Furthermore, methods for achieving carbon neutrality were discussed at the South Chungcheong Province Public Architects' meeting [22], and the construction of the nation's first wooden apartment in Gaewoonsan Village, Jongam-dong, presents a carbon-neutral housing alternative [33], making carbon neutrality practices visible in various sectors [43].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷⚠️ Renewable Energy Expansion and Current Challenges",
        "content": "The government has set a goal of supplying 100GW of renewable energy by 2030 [61, 78, 104, 105], accelerating the transition to a decarbonized civilization, and to this end, the Korea Meteorological Administration is enhancing power generation predictability by providing customized weather services and 'insolation and wind speed prediction' information for renewable energy [11, 54, 67, 89]. Daegu City and Gyeongsangnam-do are expanding support for new and renewable energy housing projects and agricultural facilities [62, 68, 70, 86, 96], contributing to the community-based spread of renewable energy. However, various challenges and controversies are arising in the process of expanding renewable energy; three major difficulties hidden behind the 'rosy figures' of the 100GW renewable energy era have been mentioned [75], and public perception that fake news issues, such as 'heavy metal-laden solar panels,' are serious has exceeded 60% [59, 63, 64, 82], highlighting the importance of fact-checking platforms. In particular, civil society criticized the Jeju Provincial Council's approval of a gas power plant proposal as a declaration of abandoning carbon neutrality [98], and on-site difficulties were also reported, such as criticisms that Hwasun County's resident-participatory new and renewable energy project lacks specific design despite existing regulations [103]. Furthermore, areas requiring political and social consensus remain, including the urban gas industry's rebuttal regarding the recognition of air-source heat pumps as renewable energy [73], and the question of 'who will own it' during the public renewable energy legislation process [72, 80].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Response and New Research Trends",
        "content": "The international community is confronting new scientific facts alongside various efforts to address climate change. The UN Environment Programme honored Pacific students who spearheaded the International Court of Justice's advisory opinion on climate change [112], recognizing the contributions of the younger generation. UN Climate Change has resumed efforts to strengthen the NAZCA portal for non-state climate action [118], emphasizing the importance of multilateral cooperation, and Malaysia has set a goal of transitioning from 'nation-building' to 'carbon neutrality' [124]. Meanwhile, new research results have raised the possibility that hydrogen could contribute to global warming [121], suggesting the need for in-depth review of energy transition technologies. A study by the University of Arizona shows changes in income due to climate change [122], broadening the understanding of climate change's impact on socioeconomic structures. In Japan, a group of citizen plaintiffs filed the first climate lawsuit questioning the state's responsibility for climate change [107, 111], sparking international discussions on climate accountability. Alongside these international efforts, there is a growing call for more aggressive policies to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees after COP30 [109].",

    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we have examined the severity of the climate crisis, various domestic and international efforts to combat it, and the challenges encountered in the process of expanding renewable energy. This is a time when sustained attention and concrete action on climate change are becoming even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
