      {
        "title": "🔴 Spread of Climate Change Denial Amidst Extreme Weather Events",
        "content": "As historic winter storms and cold waves recently struck North America, former U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly mocked climate change concerns, asking 'Where is global warming?' [21, 28, 31, 35, 39, 41, 43, 50, 52, 54]. However, scientists warn that such extreme winter storms can intensify due to climate change, and experts in Virginia have pointed out that these are 'not natural phenomena,' emphasizing that climate change is still ongoing [22, 24, 39, 43, 52, 54]. This is considered a dangerous attempt that could obscure public perception of the reality and impacts of climate change [29, 37].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Retreat and Challenges in International Climate Action",
        "content": "Concerning trends in climate action have also been observed within the international community. The number of panels focused on climate and nature at the World Economic Forum (WEF) decreased by 60% compared to 2024, raising concerns that the climate agenda might be deprioritized [34, 55]. Furthermore, instances of restricting access to climate change information have occurred, such as the U.S. National Park Service removing signs explaining climate change impacts at Fort Sumter, a Civil War historical site, under directives from the Trump administration [30, 44, 45, 48]. Meanwhile, an international think tank report indicates that 32 fossil fuel companies account for half of global carbon dioxide emissions, with a deepening concentration among a few state-owned enterprises, making discussions on accountability for climate change and the role of corporations even more crucial [20, 33].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Response Efforts and Corporate Progress",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts and positive achievements in responding to climate change have continued. SBS reporter Seo Dong-gyun received the 'Climate Change Journalist Award,' recognizing his contribution to shaping the climate agenda in the media [1, 6]. SK ecoplant and LS Cable & System demonstrated their corporate environmental responsibility efforts by achieving 'Leadership A-' and Leadership ratings, respectively, in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change response assessment [2, 4]. In Yangpyeong-gun, climate change response farming design education was successfully completed [5], and Hanwha General Insurance achieved numerically proven results in its eco-friendly 'upstream chain' [7]. Korea East-West Power held a results briefing for its 2025 carbon neutrality and environmental conservation joint projects [9, 12], and Seongbuk-gu launched a 'Zero Disposable Cups' campaign to practice carbon neutrality, showcasing ongoing efforts by local governments, public institutions, and corporations [10].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Energy Policy Discussions and Challenges for Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "In domestic energy policy discussions, various approaches to achieving carbon neutrality targets were presented. The Korean Nuclear Society and nuclear power experts emphasized the importance of nuclear power, arguing that an additional 20 new nuclear power plants are needed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet AI electricity demand [8, 11]. Meanwhile, the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Maritime Affairs Committee of the Chungnam Provincial Council called for strengthening climate change response and support for agricultural and fishing communities [3]. At a public hearing on integrated environmental issues for Gwangju and Jeollanam-do, the opinion was raised that carbon neutrality policies should be systematically pursued at the regional level [13, 14]. Efforts to expand renewable energy also continued, with public institutions urgently seeking solar power sites based on their renewable energy performance evaluations [16]. A Jeonbuk Provincial Council member hosted a forum to discuss the introduction of agri-photovoltaic systems, exploring ways to expand renewable energy [17, 19]. Korea Southern Power contributed to expanding renewable energy infrastructure by conducting on-site management of wind power complexes in the Gangwon and Gyeongbuk regions [18].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Crisis Impacts and Search for Innovative Responses",
        "content": "Globally, the impacts of climate change are affecting ecosystems, with reports of changes in the quality and supply of flower nectar [26] and silent changes in the world's most abundant forests [40]. Research has also been published indicating that the cost of climate change has nearly doubled due to ocean damage, highlighting the importance of protecting marine ecosystems [27]. However, there is also positive news. Research suggests that sea turtles may be more resilient to global warming than expected [36], and whales have been observed sharing resources to survive against climate change [53]. The European Union has been recommended to explore the use of quantum technology to address climate change [51], and international corporations continue their eco-friendly efforts, with Sofidel achieving an A- rating in the climate change and forest sectors in the CDP assessment [38].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the ongoing diverse efforts for climate action, both domestically and internationally, even amidst extreme weather events and the spread of climate change denial. This is a critical juncture where global solidarity and science-based communication are becoming increasingly important in responding to the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
