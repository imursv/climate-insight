        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening Domestic Climate Diplomacy and Leadership",
        "content": "Yeosu City has been finally confirmed as the host city for the 2026 UN Climate Change Convention Climate Week, with a forum for climate diplomacy scheduled to open this April [2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This event will serve as a crucial opportunity to showcase Korea's climate change response efforts to the international community [4]. Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea has strengthened its international climate leadership by achieving 'Leadership' in the climate change response sector of the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) [5]. Domestic political circles, including the Yeosu City Council and Assemblyman Min Hyung-bae, also welcomed Yeosu City's selection as the host city and expressed anticipation for its successful staging [21, 23].",

        "title": "🌱 Technological Innovation and Public-Private Cooperation for Accelerating Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Domestic companies and the government are actively working towards achieving carbon neutrality goals. Notably, LG Uplus and GS E&C are gaining attention for signing a 20-year renewable energy supply contract to accelerate the carbon-neutral transition of their data centers [28, 31, 38, 42, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55, 58, 59, 64, 66, 68, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 136, 137, 157]. The government has identified seven promising future energy technologies to lead a carbon-neutral society and declared 2026 as the inaugural year for implementing green transition, demonstrating its commitment to transforming carbon neutrality from an 'obligation' into a driver for 'growth' [26, 40, 44, 45, 46, 57, 60, 81, 109]. Furthermore, artificial intelligence technology is being actively utilized in climate change response, including the development of a conversational air pollution and climate change prediction application using Agentic AI [3], and highly popular AI-powered farming education for climate change response in Jangheung-gun [9, 16, 24]. Local governments are continuing their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality in their communities through initiatives such as training carbon neutrality experts [29, 32, 34, 41, 56, 65, 74] and supporting the purchase of electric and hydrogen vehicles [39, 53, 67] [15, 27, 30, 33, 36, 43, 47, 52, 61, 62, 63, 69, 70, 89, 95, 98, 99, 100, 102, 113, 117, 121, 132, 135]. Various technological innovations are also anticipated, such as the development of a carbon-neutral boiler by an MIT startup [37] and Enertech's presentation of innovative power quality solutions [35, 70].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Worsening Climate Change and Warning Signs",
        "content": "Warning bells are ringing globally, signaling the severity of climate change. In South Africa, a catastrophic flood, which doubled in rainfall intensity due to climate change, resulted in 300 deaths [8, 151], indicating a worsening of extreme weather phenomena, including both high and low temperature extremes [141]. Scientists have confirmed that destructive landslides are becoming more common across Alaska, particularly in the southeast [142, 149], and Asia's vulnerability has been highlighted as it suffers from climate change and natural disasters while having one of the lowest insurance penetration rates [146]. China's average temperature reached a record high for the second consecutive year, demonstrating the acceleration of climate change [154], and a Dutch court ordered the government to develop a carbon neutrality plan, stating it failed to protect the residents of Bonaire from climate change [25, 80]. Furthermore, discussions about the difficulty of coexistence between renewable energy and nuclear power, coupled with fears of blackouts, have revealed the complexity of energy transition [88].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Unexpected Adaptation and Resilience",
        "content": "Amidst grim forecasts, unexpected adaptation and resilience to climate change are being observed in some regions. Research has shown that polar bears have become fatter and healthier despite the decrease in sea ice, and polar bears in the Svalbard region are also demonstrating remarkable resilience to climate change [1, 22, 155]. Internationally, corporate efforts to address climate change continue, with Honda being selected as a CDP 'Climate Change A List' company for the third consecutive year [140]. Seattle is investing approximately $1 million to support communities most affected by climate change [150], and innovative approaches are being explored, such as discussions about funding cultivated meat to combat climate change [145]. Positive changes are also being detected in the industrial sector, with one domestic steel company achieving the highest rating in climate change response [11].",

      }

    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted both the threats of climate change and the diverse domestic and international efforts and adaptation cases to overcome them. Through continued interest and cooperation, we must work towards creating a healthier planet. This concludes today's climate briefing."
