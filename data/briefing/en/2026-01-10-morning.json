    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 U.S. Withdrawal from Climate Agreements and International Repercussions",
        "content": "Former U.S. President Trump has once again withdrawn from the UN Climate Convention and also pulled funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), headquartered in Songdo, Incheon, casting a shadow over international climate cooperation [2, 7]. This U.S. decision has drawn heightened criticism, especially as it comes after the IPCC clearly stated that human activities are the primary cause of climate change [23]. Questions are being raised about what the U.S. withdrawal from global climate treaties will mean for climate action [33, 34], potentially causing significant setbacks to international collective response efforts.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Real-world Impacts of Climate Change: Reshaping Winter and Societal Costs",
        "content": "Globally, climate change is reshaping the characteristics of winter, directly impacting our daily lives [22]. Domestically, the effects are directly felt, with winter festivals being successively canceled or postponed due to warmer winters [4]. Just as the ice on India's Chadar River is being affected by climate change, threatening the livelihoods of ice transporters [26], climate change is also causing severe problems for the livelihoods and cultures of specific local communities.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Multifaceted Efforts for Domestic Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Domestically, multifaceted efforts are underway to achieve a carbon-neutral society. The Rural Development Administration (RDA) has recognized the impact of climate change on agriculture and launched an 'online educational course for low-carbon agricultural products' [1], and the Fruit Growers Association has also begun free winter orchard management training to address climate change [5]. Pyeongtaek City is promoting 37 technology dissemination projects for climate change response [3, 6], and Daegu City presented the goal of 'realizing a pleasant carbon-neutral city' in its 2026 environmental and water resources work report [11]. Furthermore, Changwon City in Gyeongnam is encouraging eco-friendly transportation by increasing carbon neutrality points for users of its public bicycle 'Nubija' [10], and the Cheongju City Policy Institute is recruiting carbon neutrality research talent [13], demonstrating active participation from various local governments and institutions in overcoming the climate crisis [8, 12]. Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) also showed efforts to find solutions on-site through inspections of its renewable energy equity-invested companies [16].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Action and Perception",
        "content": "The international community is demonstrating diverse approaches and perceptions regarding climate change. While the European Union (EU) has been observed to be taking a pause in its 'carbon neutrality' policy implementation [9, 14], Delaware is moving towards net-zero emissions targets through its climate action plan [27]. Bill Gates has emphasized the need for funding in climate change and child health sectors [18], and discussions are actively underway on how to build more resilient communities to climate change [21]. Meanwhile, as the overall status of climate change is being presented as of 2026 [19], a perception has emerged that most people believe climate change primarily affects others [25], suggesting a lack of universal awareness of the climate crisis. Past global warming cases are providing insights into future precipitation patterns, emphasizing the importance of climate change research [28].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Challenges and Controversies in Climate Policy",
        "content": "Several challenges and controversies are being raised in the implementation of climate policies. Lee Sang-il, Mayor of Yongin Special City, stated that RE100 is not mandatory, revealing the opaque status of Yongin City's renewable energy plans [17]. Furthermore, some argue that climate policies are driven by 'meaningless numbers,' raising questions about their effectiveness [29]. In addition, scientific and political debates continue regarding the direction of climate change response, including hearings held on movements to ban research into technological climate interventions, such as the use of reflective particles for solar reflection, also known as 'geoengineering' [32].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Through today's briefing, we have examined the urgent threat of climate change, along with various domestic and international efforts to overcome it, and the policy challenges that still persist. This concludes today's climate briefing."
