        "title": "🔴 Climate Change Denialism and Extreme Weather Events",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has recently drawn backlash from the climate science community by repeatedly questioning the occurrence of winter storms despite global warming [1, 143]. However, the United States has experienced tangible damage, including at least 29 deaths due to Arctic cold snaps and destructive winter storms [13, 132], demonstrating how global warming is reshaping winter storms and testing disaster response capabilities [127, 142]. While these cold snaps are reigniting the global warming debate [137], scientific research continues to elucidate the complex connections between global warming and heavy snowfall [123, 128].",

        "title": "⚠️ The Deepening Reality and Social Costs of the Climate Crisis",
        "content": "Climate change is incurring immense social and economic costs globally. Farmers in Indonesia and Vietnam are crying out due to damages caused by climate change [4], and in Jeju, the bee population, a barometer of the climate crisis, is declining due to ecosystem destruction from development [5]. Furthermore, an era where climate drives finance has arrived, exemplified by research on 'Gyeonggi Climate Insurance' data analyzing the social costs of abnormal weather on the Korean Peninsula [10]. Internationally, 55 weather disasters, each costing over $1 billion, occurred last year [135], and in Colorado, climate change has incurred billions of dollars in costs [134]. Notably, record-breaking heatwaves of 48.9°C and severe wildfires in Victoria, Australia [145, 147], are sounding an alarm about research indicating that billions of people worldwide will face extreme heat by 2050 [141, 146].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Efforts to Achieve Domestic Carbon Neutrality Goals",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts are underway to achieve carbon neutrality. Hyundai Steel, the only domestic steel company, earned a 'Leadership A-' rating in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change response assessment, demonstrating its corporate climate action efforts [2, 3, 9]. Local governments are promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, including river maintenance in Changnyeong-gun [7], the introduction of practical agricultural technologies in Uiseong-gun [8], and strengthening tap water supply systems for proactive drought response in Gangneung-si [11, 14, 15]. Notably, Daegu City has encouraged participation in the 'Carbon Neutrality Point System,' which incentivizes citizens' voluntary savings of electricity, water, and city gas, resulting in an annual greenhouse gas reduction of over 30,000 tons [16, 17, 18, 23, 28, 37, 45, 122]. Chungcheongnam-do is accelerating the carbon-neutral transition in the transportation sector by expanding hydrogen bus subsidies to up to 460 million KRW [20, 30, 38, 39, 41, 46], and the Boryeong former mining area is planned to be utilized as a carbon neutrality education center [27, 47].",

        "title": "🌍 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Current Challenges",
        "content": "As the transition to renewable energy accelerates, GS E&C has made its debut in India's new and renewable energy market with the completion of a solar power complex [36, 54, 59, 60, 62, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73, 74, 84, 93, 94, 95, 96, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 107, 108, 113, 116, 119, 120]. Domestically, the proliferation of renewable energy has faced difficulties due to grid saturation issues [70], but Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) has embarked on innovations to resolve the 13-year-long grid acceptance problem [52, 86, 90, 92, 103], and the Ministry of Climate and Energy has moved to address the 'bottleneck' in renewable energy expansion [79]. Furthermore, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) held a 'Corporate Renewable Energy Matching Day,' achieving direct transaction agreements for 100MW of renewable energy and supporting companies' renewable energy procurement [51, 55, 56, 66, 75, 78, 82, 87, 91, 97, 109, 110]. In Jeju, 'RE100 Tangerines,' cultivated with renewable energy, were shipped nationwide for the first time, setting a new milestone for clean energy agriculture [89]. However, concerns are also being raised that the surge in AI-driven electricity demand and grid saturation may be difficult to manage with renewable energy alone [48, 70].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Energy Policy Discussions and Future Outlook",
        "content": "Policy discussions surrounding energy transition are also actively underway. Changes in government policy are being observed, such as the confirmation of construction for two new nuclear power plants to address the surge in AI-driven electricity demand [48, 49], and arguments are being made that nuclear power and renewable energy must advance together with trust and implementation [69, 80]. Meanwhile, it has also been pointed out that Korea is vulnerable to 'energy geopolitics' and that carbon neutrality without structural reform is an illusion [21]. Modeling results post-COP30, which suggest a 'significant shortfall' in achieving global climate targets [139], indicate that current efforts are insufficient, and climate change continues to pose ongoing challenges across various sectors, including reservoir management and the global sports industry [129, 130].",
