      {
        "title": "🔴 Crisis in International Climate Cooperation and US Withdrawal Movements",
        "content": "Today, the international community expresses deep concern over the former US administration's moves to backtrack on climate change response policies. Reports indicate that a country identified as the world's second-largest emitter may withdraw from the greenhouse gas reduction framework, which is expected to disrupt global climate response efforts [1, 8]. In fact, former President Trump characterized climate change as a 'hoax' and issued a sweeping order to withdraw the US from 66 international organizations, including the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change [2, 5, 6, 10, 56, 57, 72]. Scientists warn that these actions by the US will severely hinder progress on climate change, and some markets analyze Trump's interest in Greenland as being linked to the melting of Arctic ice due to climate change [53, 56, 67, 77].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Transition and Policy Reinforcement",
        "content": "Domestically, institutional foundations and investments for climate change response are expanding. The 'Climate Change Response Office,' a control tower for climate crisis in the agriculture and food sector, has been newly established, and the National Assembly is encouraging climate action by launching the '2026 Republic of Korea Green Climate Award' competition [3, 4]. The Korea Environment Corporation is investing 110 billion won to operate a greenhouse gas reduction and carbon neutrality support system, and local governments such as Jeju City and Yeoncheon County are also showing active movements, investing large budgets in creating carbon-neutral cities or signing related agreements [12, 14, 16, 17]. In particular, Changwon City is implementing policies to encourage citizen participation, such as doubling carbon neutrality points when using the public bicycle 'Nubija' [11, 18, 19, 20].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Renewable Energy Expansion Efforts and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "In the renewable energy sector, Korea Southern Power has completed the establishment of AI learning data for renewable energy, a first among power generation companies, and is accelerating technological innovation and stable operation by strengthening on-site inspections and safety management of its investee companies [22, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 43, 44, 46, 49]. Furthermore, overseas investments are active, with a Singaporean asset management company investing 360 billion won in a domestic renewable energy platform [30, 41]. The '2026 Economic Strategy' also states that a full-scale effort will be made to expand renewable energy to accelerate greenhouse gas reduction, anticipating growth in the domestic renewable energy market [40]. However, international trends such as the slowdown in renewable energy facility expansion in the US, and the lack of discussion on renewable energy expansion plans during the nuclear power public debate process, remain challenges to be addressed [24, 28, 50].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Change Impacts and Efforts to Build Resilience",
        "content": "The impacts of climate change are spreading globally, and its unexpected side effects are becoming a reality [55]. The effects on ecosystems are severe, with tropical trees being disadvantaged in the fight against climate change and the Earth's nitrogen cycle being disrupted [60, 70]. Extreme weather events such as December floods and the worsening heatwaves in Australia are also analyzed as roles of climate change, making urgent preparation essential [61, 78]. Amidst this crisis, performances like 'Dimanche' are contributing to raising climate change awareness, and discussions are actively underway on ways to enhance community climate change resilience, along with claims that purchasing electric vehicles can help combat climate change [54, 58, 59].",
        "tone": "warning"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we confirmed that despite the crisis in international climate cooperation, efforts for carbon neutrality transition and renewable energy expansion are continuing both domestically and internationally. We once again emphasize the importance of global solidarity and concrete action to address the climate crisis, and we ask for your continued interest and participation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
