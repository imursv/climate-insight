      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and Its All-Encompassing Impacts",
        "content": "Today's top news once again underscores the severity of the climate crisis. The global temperature in 2025 is projected to be the third highest on record, clearly demonstrating the reality of the climate crisis [4]. Indeed, the world has experienced record high temperatures for three consecutive years [57], leading to direct economic and social damages such as a 12% reduction in Americans' wages and the worsening living conditions for the people of Eswatini due to climate change [28, 29]. Water scarcity and the deterioration of living environments have reached critical levels worldwide, with intensifying water problems in Africa and a growing threat of displacement for residents in Bolivia due to drought and increased salinity [36, 56]. In response to these threats, seawater desalination projects are surging, which simultaneously serves as evidence of the severe water shortage [33, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, efforts to address climate change and achieve carbon neutrality are accelerating across multiple fronts. Climate change was a major agenda item at the 2nd Bhutan International ESG Alliance Forum [1], and local governments such as Haman County and Gijang County are proactively responding to pest and disease issues caused by climate change [2, 3]. Initiatives encouraging daily practices are also active, including the opening of Gwangmyeong's 'G-Smart Hub,' a carbon-neutral smart city base [6], and Wonju City's operation of carbon-neutral experience programs [8, 12]. Notably, Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) is pursuing both carbon neutrality and regional economic revitalization by utilizing livestock manure as solid fuel [7, 10, 11], and KEPCO KPS is investing approximately 2 trillion won to lead the carbon neutrality sector [13]. A policy commitment to eradicate illegal petroleum distribution and transition to carbon-neutral fuels has also been confirmed [9]. Furthermore, Chungcheongbuk-do Province, the Geum River Basin Environmental Office, local governments, and energy-related organizations have signed an MOU to accelerate renewable energy deployment [14, 17], and Korea Western Power (KOWEPO) has set a target to supply 13.5 GW of renewable energy by 2040 [16]. These examples demonstrate that major domestic companies and institutions are actively embarking on concrete plans and investments to expand renewable energy [15, 18, 19, 20, 21].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Change Adaptation and Policy Exploration",
        "content": "The international community is undertaking various adaptation and policy efforts in the face of climate change threats. Brazil has joined the fight against biodiversity loss by announcing a biodiversity pledge for nature and climate change [30, 58], and farmers in Tajikistan are adapting their agricultural practices to climate change [39]. This aligns with the World Economic Forum's proposal to recognize farmers as key players in climate change response and provide them with support [23]. Additionally, cruise lines are contributing to public awareness by educating passengers on how to track climate change in polar glaciers [40, 54], and countries are outlining specific policy directions, such as Scotland including electric vehicle-related content in its draft climate change plan [53]. Research and preparation for a carbon-neutral transition are underway across industries, with a survey report on the carbon-neutral mining market from 2025 to 2033 being published [55], and experts' expectations for China's energy and climate actions in 2026 are also rising [59].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Overlooked or Newly Emerging Climate Threats and Discussions",
        "content": "Climate change is giving rise to unexpected new threats and social debates. In Iran, drought has been identified as one of the hidden keywords behind bloodshed, demonstrating how the climate crisis can exacerbate social instability [22]. Furthermore, unforeseen threats such as deaths from mushroom poisoning due to climate change are occurring [38], and severe gaps in housing insurance due to climate change have been exposed, raising the need for a revamp of insurance systems [34]. The observation that climate change is not being addressed in discussions about data centers in Michigan suggests that climate issues can be overlooked during economic development [25], and questions about whether Costa Rica's cloud forests can cope with climate change highlight the vulnerability of ecosystems [35]. Meanwhile, discussions are deepening on legal and social response measures, including the consideration of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for future climate change-related disputes [37].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the widespread escalation of the climate crisis, the diverse domestic and international efforts to address it, and newly emerging threats and discussions. Continuous vigilance and swift action are more crucial than ever. This concludes the climate briefing for January 16, 2026."
