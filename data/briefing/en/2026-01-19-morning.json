      {
        "title": "⚠️🇰🇷 Direct Impacts of Climate Change in Korea and the Need for Response",
        "content": "The direct impacts of climate change are clearly observed in domestic disaster sites. Last year, there was an increase in fire emergency calls and a decrease in calls for beehive removal and rescue operations. The aging of transported patients was also confirmed, indicating an urgent need for changes in the disaster response system [2, 5, 8]. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced fishery disease management measures in response to the evolution of aquatic diseases caused by the climate crisis [4, 7]. Furthermore, local governments are analyzing the threats of climate change and seeking proactive responses, such as Wonju City completing its final report on urban climate change disaster vulnerability analysis and Chungcheongbuk-do signing a business agreement to prepare for the climate crisis [6, 27]. These changes clearly demonstrate the widespread impacts of climate change on our society and emphasize the importance of multifaceted preparedness and adaptation efforts.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Green Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, various efforts are actively underway to respond to climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. Gangneung City is accelerating its response to climate change by creating parks and green healing spaces [1], and Dongdaemun-gu won a Social Value Award for its 'Carbon Neutrality in Daily Life' activities, shifting carbon neutrality efforts from campaigns to everyday practices [10, 11, 13]. The Seoul Energy Dream Center plans to pilot a 'Carbon Neutrality Experience Center' [12], and Chungnam Province is promoting the spread of private green buildings to achieve its 2045 carbon neutrality target [14, 18, 19, 20]. Haenam County is developing its Resource Circulation Complex Center as a carbon-neutral hub, and Daejeon Seo-gu and Sejong City are also striving for carbon neutrality implementation across their communities, including through carbon-neutral apartment practice competitions and promoting green transitions in daily life [17, 21, 22, 23]. Furthermore, the expansion of hydrogen vehicle supply in Jinju City [24], Korea East-West Power's emphasis on carbon-free fuel conversion and pumped-hydro storage to complement renewable energy intermittency [16], and the growth of K-Transformer's technological capabilities in the renewable energy sector [25] along with strengthened new and renewable energy training programs [26] all show positive signs for achieving carbon neutrality goals through energy transition.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🔴🌍 Widespread Impacts of the International Climate Crisis",
        "content": "Internationally, climate change is having widespread impacts, ranging from sporting events to human rights issues and marine ecosystems. Notably, it has been repeatedly reported that the list of cities capable of hosting the Olympics is continuously shrinking due to climate change, with a decrease in potential Winter Olympic host cities in Europe [31, 33, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. According to one study, marine damage is nearly doubling the overall costs of climate change, warning that ecosystem destruction directly translates into economic burdens [35, 37]. Moreover, climate change acts in ways that threaten human rights, emerging as a serious threat to human life and dignity, with climate refugee scientist Camille Parmesan, for example, revealing the real impacts of climate change on life [36, 40]. These reports clearly demonstrate that the climate crisis is no longer a localized issue but a global catastrophe.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Policy and Financial Trends, and Efforts Towards Solutions",
        "content": "The international community's response to climate change presents both positive efforts and challenging aspects simultaneously. Concerns are being raised about the reflection of climate risks in financial markets, with some instances of Wall Street turning its back on climate change or climate change blind spots being recognized as liabilities on financial statements [29, 30]. Furthermore, news of the United States withdrawing from a global climate change network once again reminds us of the importance of international cooperation [32]. However, positive movements are also observed concurrently. One cruise ship is educating passengers on how to track climate change in polar glaciers, encouraging citizen participation [43], and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is supporting India's climate change adaptation, response, and mitigation efforts [46], demonstrating ongoing solution efforts through science, technology, and education. These multi-layered international trends show that political will, financial responsibility, and efforts to raise public awareness are all crucial in responding to the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the widespread impacts of climate change both domestically and internationally, as well as the multifaceted efforts to address them. Our sustained attention and action are crucial to overcoming the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
