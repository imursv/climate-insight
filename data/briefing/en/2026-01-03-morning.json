        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Crisis, Becoming a Reality",
        "content": "Sinkholes have occurred in Turkey's granary region due to the impacts of climate change, raising growing concerns about food security [1, 3]. Additionally, the UK recorded an average temperature of 10.09°C in 2025, marking it as the warmest year on record, which scientists have pointed to as clear evidence of climate change impacts [38, 41]. As freshwater fish worldwide face extinction and oceans send warning signals, unusual phenomena are being reported, including changes in ancient lifestyles in Ethiopia, winter plant blooming, and the occurrence of Storm Francis in Morocco [23, 24, 32, 34, 35]. These phenomena support scientists' warnings about the increased likelihood of extreme weather events due to human-induced climate change [36]. Notably, a study in China also found that building material stockpiles are increasing embodied carbon emissions, threatening the achievement of future climate goals [31].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts: Accelerating Climate Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality Transition",
        "content": "Domestically, as the climate crisis becomes a constant reality in the Jeonnam region, there is a growing recognition of the urgent need to shift towards 'adaptation policies' [2]. With local government policies closely linked to citizens' lives and the importance of carbon-neutral urban planning being emphasized, conditions for sustainable cities are under discussion [4, 5, 8, 12]. Seongbuk-gu has designated an environmental education center, expressing its commitment to becoming a leading carbon-neutral city, while Anyang University has declared the establishment of an AI/SW/ESG-based carbon-neutral management system [7, 9]. Furthermore, the Korea National Railway and the Korea Energy Agency are encouraging citizen participation by hosting public contests for achieving carbon neutrality, and multifaceted efforts are underway to meet the 2030 carbon neutrality target [6, 10, 11].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Focus on Renewable Energy Expansion and Energy Transition Investment",
        "content": "Energy transition is expected to accelerate in 2026, with significant attention on renewable energy and grid investments [20]. South Korea and Germany are strengthening international cooperation by exploring ways to expand renewable energy and integrate power grids [14, 18]. Domestically, the Korea Energy Agency has launched a pilot project competition for utilizing renewable energy beyond zero-energy building sites [13, 22]. Gunsan City declared 2026 as the inaugural year of 'South Korea's Renewable Energy Capital,' expressing a strong regional commitment [15]. Chungnam Province is expanding practical renewable energy deployment, such as installing solar power facilities on idle public institution sites [19]. Korea Western Power is contributing to energy transition by supplying renewable energy to Soonchunhyang University campus [17], but an analysis also suggests that emission allowance prices are emerging as a key factor for renewable energy proliferation [16]. Meanwhile, Professor Hong Jong-ho proposed the necessity of domestic carbon tax burden and fund circulation, urging in-depth discussions on energy policy [21].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Actions and Response Patterns",
        "content": "Internationally, Southern Tier communities are receiving grants to support climate change response projects [25, 30], and Rochester and Geneva are continuing their climate change mitigation efforts with 'Climate Smart Communities Grants' [27]. Various attempts are being made to raise public awareness, such as the introduction of short documentaries addressing climate change and social justice [28], and the importance of mental health support to cope with 'eco-anxiety' caused by climate change has also been highlighted [26]. In California, there have been new updates to climate disclosure laws [29], and in Southeast Asia, an annual survey to understand attitudes towards climate change is being conducted, indicating active policy and social responses [33]. Despite these efforts, policy challenges are also arising in the promotion of renewable energy projects, such as Denmark's Ørsted filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a freeze on wind farm leases [40]. Meanwhile, an analysis from the UK in 2025 showed that despite record generation from wind, solar, and biomass, gas power generation still increased [42], and positive news was also reported regarding a decrease in the number of deaths due to extreme weather [39].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "The climate-related news covered in today's briefing illustrates the intersection of a global crisis with active response efforts both domestically and internationally. It is time to recognize the severity of climate change and move towards stronger action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
