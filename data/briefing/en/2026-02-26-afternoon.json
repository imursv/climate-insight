    "opening": "Good morning/afternoon. Welcome to the climate briefing for February 26, 2026. Today, we will provide a comprehensive update on the escalating global climate crisis, alongside various domestic and international efforts in climate change response and the transition to carbon neutrality.",

      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Policy Setbacks",
        "content": "Today, the world faces extreme impacts from climate change and concerning policy setbacks. The Iberian Peninsula and Morocco have experienced devastating storms and floods intensified by climate change [107, 117, 139, 140], tropical flowers are blooming irregularly by several months [119, 141], and species like emperor penguins and monarch butterflies are facing threats to their survival and migration [108, 114, 116]. Furthermore, new research warns that increased air conditioning use could exacerbate climate change [106], and concerns have been raised about rising coffee prices due to declining yields [112]. Meanwhile, policy retreat movements have been observed, such as the removal of climate change-related information from Glacier National Park [111, 126] and Germany eliminating mandatory renewable energy clauses [69], further emphasizing the urgency of addressing the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Expanding Domestic Climate Change Response and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Domestically, various response and adaptation efforts are expanding to counter the threat of climate change. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries plans to transition to AI-based fisheries resource management [4], and Kyungpook National University's College of Veterinary Medicine has opened a climate change vector surveillance hub center [5], strengthening future prediction and proactive responses. Gangwon Province has completed a 10-year groundwater management blueprint [18], and Bonghwa County conducted a large-scale wildfire virtual evacuation drill to check disaster preparedness [19]. Additionally, the Asia Water Council and Korea Water Resources Corporation are strengthening water and climate change resilience in the Asia-Pacific region through cooperation with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) [2, 11, 12, 17, 22]. Educational and awareness-raising efforts are also active, such as the reopening of the Cheongju Land Climate Change Experience Center [6, 15] and J-League's participation in climate change response [1, 7].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition Towards Carbon Neutrality Goals",
        "content": "Efforts to expand renewable energy for the transition to a carbon-neutral society are accelerating across South Korea. Daegu Metropolitan City recorded the highest cumulative renewable energy supply nationwide [61, 65, 76], and Paju City and Yongin Special City were recognized as renewable energy cities and carbon-neutral climate-leading cities, receiving Green Climate Awards [23, 24, 56, 86]. Korea Western Power is accelerating the pace of energy transition by holding workshops that integrate renewable energy development and operation [52, 59, 63, 66, 70, 72, 78, 82, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 92, 97], and Hyundai Steel is strengthening its capacity to supply carbon-neutral materials in the industrial sector by commencing mass production of carbon-reduced steel plates [32, 44]. The Ministry of Education is promoting the 'Sunshine-Connected Schools' project to install solar panels in all schools [43, 49], and the government and ruling party are pushing the 'Renewable Energy City Act' as a top priority [54, 98, 101]. While these efforts from the government and public institutions continue, the fact that 16 cities and counties in the Gyeongbuk region received the 'lowest' grade for their carbon neutrality plans in an assessment by the Green Transition Institute indicates a need for improvement [33].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Cooperation and Raising Climate Change Awareness",
        "content": "The importance of enhancing global awareness of climate change and international cooperation is being emphasized. Nigeria is seeking international cooperation to address regional climate impacts [136], and the Earth Journalism Network (EJN) is strengthening local capacities by supporting climate change-related programs in Indonesia and Thailand [118]. In Vermont, a bill has been introduced to implement climate change education in schools, demonstrating a move to enhance climate literacy for future generations [110]. Legal discussions on climate change responsibility are also active, with the Supreme Court taking on a climate change lawsuit against an oil and gas company in Colorado [128]. Fiji and Tuvalu are set to host pre-COP31 climate meetings [143], which will serve as an important international diplomatic platform to amplify the voices of climate-vulnerable nations.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, despite the deepening global climate crisis, diverse efforts for carbon neutrality and climate adaptation continue both domestically and internationally. To address such complex and critical challenges, international solidarity and sustained domestic action will become even more crucial. This concludes the climate briefing for February 26, 2026."
