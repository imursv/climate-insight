      {
        "title": "🔴 🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Crisis Warning: Unusual Phenomena and Deepening Damage",
        "content": "Today, news has emerged domestically regarding unusual phenomena and deepening damage resulting from the direct impacts of climate change. Notably, in the Jangsu region, an apple harvesting experience event was canceled for the first time in 23 years, underscoring the tangible effects of climate change [1]. Furthermore, despite it being January, an unprecedented large-scale wildfire occurred, raising concerns about the complex causes involving both human factors and climate change [2, 5]. These phenomena clearly demonstrate that the threat of climate change to the domestic agricultural economy and ecosystems is no longer a future concern but a present reality.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community: Climate Change Impacts and Severity",
        "content": "Across the international community, widespread and severe impacts due to climate change have also been reported. In the United States, salaries have decreased by 12% due to climate change, and economic and social damages are materializing, including the worst power outages in the MISO region over the past decade [17, 20]. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that oceans will reach record high temperatures in 2025, indicating a deepening of climate change impacts [21]. Ecosystem and health issues have also been highlighted, such as an increased risk of super-colonies of bees and wasps in winter [23], and worsening migraines [26]. With news also emerging of climate change occurring in Australia [28], the global climate crisis appears to be intensifying worldwide.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 🌱 Domestic Climate Change Response Policies and Practical Efforts",
        "content": "Amidst this severity, various policy discussions and practical efforts to address climate change are continuing domestically. In the agricultural sector, there are plans to invest 30 billion won in climate change response and digital transformation [4], and Jeju Province is making specific adaptation efforts, such as changing major crop varieties to suit climate change [6]. Furthermore, Changwon City is raising public awareness by exhibiting carbon-neutral art contest entries [9, 10, 11], and the Head of Ulsan Dong-gu District is discussing renewable energy development directions, with claims that Ulsan is an optimal location for floating offshore wind power [13, 14, 15], indicating high interest in expanding renewable energy. Meanwhile, while the urgency of long-term and strategic climate change response policies is emphasized [3], challenges also exist in the policy-making process, such as strong opposition from the industry regarding moves to include air-source heat in renewable energy [12].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 🌱 International Community: Climate Response Strategies and Discussions",
        "content": "The international community is approaching climate change adaptation and solution-seeking from multiple angles. Scientists are developing antacids for the ocean to combat global warming [19], and telecom operator Zain demonstrated corporate climate leadership by receiving the top 'A' rating in CDP Climate Change 2025 [24]. Amidst active academic discussions, such as climate change symposiums [18], Nana Akua emphasized the need to adapt to climate change [25], and Czech scientists even proposed logging as a unique solution to combat climate change [27]. However, many challenges still remain for international cooperation and goal achievement, such as Nigeria and South Africa announcing plans to increase fossil fuel production, thereby threatening climate change commitments [22].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the complex situation where the global reality of a deepening climate crisis intersects with diverse domestic and international efforts to combat it. We are once again reminded that responding to climate change is not a singular solution, but a long-term challenge requiring a multifaceted approach and sustained attention. This concludes today's climate briefing."
