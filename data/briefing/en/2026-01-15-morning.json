        "title": "🔴 Urgent Climate Crisis Warning and Record High Temperatures",
        "content": "Recent data indicates that 2025 was recorded as the third hottest year in Earth's history, with global warming reaching an average of 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels [38, 73, 96, 99]. Furthermore, EU scientists have warned that global warming has exceeded the critical 1.5°C limit over the past three years, and the UN weather agency noted that record global warming has continued for 11 consecutive years [43, 54]. Record heat is being observed in various parts of the world, including Phoenix, USA, which recorded its second warmest year. However, NASA, while acknowledging these record high temperatures, has shown a tendency to avoid mentioning the term 'climate change' [50, 53, 67, 74, 89]. These phenomena align with reports and academic warnings that the severity of global warming is being underestimated, which could lead to major climatic and financial risks [71, 91, 59]. In particular, a domestic prediction warns that half of Seoul's plant species could disappear by 2100 if climate change is left unaddressed, highlighting the severity of ecosystem destruction [1].",

        "title": "⚠️ Global Ripple Effects of Climate Change and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "The ripple effects of climate change are manifesting in various forms worldwide. Glaciers and ice sheets are melting faster than they can regenerate [46], and climate change is reshaping the future of the Winter Olympics, affecting the selection of host cities for sports events [40, 61, 63, 65, 69, 70, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 93]. Additionally, new hotspots for agricultural drought are emerging [47], and concerns about food security are growing, with even aquaculture feed supplies being threatened [66]. Europe's ground transportation infrastructure faces coastal flood risks at various levels of global warming [86], and extreme weather events are causing physical damage, such as the loss of 80% of trees at a landmark in Cornwall, UK, due to Storm Goretti recently [97]. Amidst this, some small US communities are building resilient water systems despite significant damage from climate change [51], and adaptation efforts are also underway, with seven winter resorts fighting against climate change [64]. Research suggesting that tree bark can have a significant impact on climate change also presents the possibility of interesting solutions [62].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "In South Korea, active movements are being observed to address the climate crisis and achieve carbon neutrality goals. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is actively promoting carbon neutrality support projects worth 250 billion won to back companies' green transition [10, 12, 13, 17], and is also paying attention to on-site voices advocating for the promotion of carbon neutrality in distribution and logistics through incentives rather than regulations [9]. Environmental public institutions are also accelerating their response to climate disasters and carbon neutrality efforts [11], and the Seoul Metropolitan Government is playing a leading role, receiving an 'A' grade for four consecutive years in the 'Urban Climate Crisis Response Assessment' [5]. At the local government level, Gwangmyeong City has opened 'G-Smart Hub,' a carbon-neutral smart city hub [16, 19, 21, 25], Daejeon City has initiated a carbon-neutral transportation transition with the completion of the Geumgo hydrogen bus charging station [20], and Gwangju City is creating 10 urban forests to combat heatwaves and fine dust [4]. Furthermore, Chungnam Province is promoting financial support for carbon-neutral businesses and leading carbon neutrality in food service establishments by phasing out single-use items [15, 26, 28], and Gyeongnam Province will also provide 2.5 billion won for carbon-neutral lifestyle practices in 2025 [23]. Pohang City has been recognized as a leading carbon-neutral city, holding the highest number of approved external projects (6) for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme nationwide [27]. In the energy transition sector, Korea East-West Power and Korea Western Power are expanding renewable energy supply, with East-West Power hosting an energy transition seminar for 2050 carbon neutrality and Western Power setting a goal to build 13.5 GW of renewable energy facilities by 2040 [7, 8, 14, 18, 24, 34, 35, 36]. The government is pursuing a plan to add 'air source heat' to the scope of renewable energy [29], and the 'upper limit' legislation for setback distance regulations for solar power generation facilities is also being discussed, which is expected to contribute to resolving regional regulatory disparities [37]. Along with the prospect that AI and grid-forming ESS will usher in an era of renewable energy as the main power source [30], various renewable energy utilization plans are also being explored, such as the creation of the Asan Lake renewable energy complex based on a community-participatory model [31] and claims about the possibility of renewable energy pensions [32]. Finally, efforts to raise overall societal awareness are also continuing, with the Onyang Laboratory Cooperative emerging as a regional environmental and ESG education specialist [22].",

        "title": "🌍 International Climate Policy Discussions and Challenges",
        "content": "The international community faces various discussions and challenges regarding climate change response. The COP30 conference revealed the paradox of global climate policy-making [48], and it was pointed out that climate action remains insufficient even in the context of children's rights [90]. Past instances of the US withdrawing from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [60] and news of a Western Illinois University professor attending a UN climate change conference [52] simultaneously demonstrate the importance and complexity of international cooperation. Meanwhile, some climate experts wish to stop using the term 'Climate Change' [39], and changes in perception and discourse on the climate crisis are also being detected, with Terence Corcoran arguing that the 'existential' climate crisis is disappearing [41]. Amidst this, Indians showed more confidence than most others in responding to climate change [56] and also displayed optimism about the role of AI [58]. However, concerns have been raised as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it will no longer calculate healthcare cost savings and prevented deaths due to air pollution regulations [95].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have seen in today's briefing, the climate crisis threatens human survival through global high-temperature phenomena and various ripple effects. However, as diverse efforts for carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition continue both domestically and internationally, this is a crucial time for closer international cooperation and policy development based on scientific evidence. This concludes today's climate briefing."
