      {
        "title": "🔴 Concerns over International Climate Policy Retreat and Science Denial",
        "content": "The international community is showing serious signs of retreating from climate change response efforts. Specifically, White House officials have stated that the U.S. Trump administration plans to 'dismantle' climate change policies and environmental regulations, and withdraw climate change-related decisions that are central to automobile regulations [112, 115, 116, 133, 138, 141, 144]. Furthermore, the 'Climate Change' chapter is set to be removed from the scientific evidence reference manual for U.S. judges, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to withdraw its own conclusion that greenhouse gases are warming the planet and threatening health [111, 118, 121, 122, 129, 139]. These actions are criticized for denying climate change science and potentially exposing communities to greater risks [129]. Meanwhile, among the populations of Czechia and Slovakia, while acknowledging climate change, skepticism about political action is growing [125].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Intensifying Impacts of Climate Change and Reality Recognition",
        "content": "The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident worldwide, with scientists emphasizing that climate change has already arrived [113, 136]. In South America, the combined effects of climate change and budget cuts have exacerbated deadly wildfires, leading to the tragic destruction of some of the world's oldest trees in Argentina's Patagonia region [114, 117, 145]. Furthermore, climate change is impacting and reshaping the reliability of Winter Olympic host locations [119, 131], and threatening to expose most homes in Belgium to extreme heat [135], demonstrating its widespread effects on human life and natural ecosystems. Domestically, warnings are being issued about the Earth getting hotter [2], and signs of ecological change are appearing, such as the discovery of a European robin, native to Europe, in Canada [5].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerated Domestic Carbon Neutrality Efforts and Policy Progress",
        "content": "Domestically, under the recognition that responding to the climate crisis is no longer an option but a necessity, diverse efforts are actively underway to achieve carbon neutrality. The government and local authorities are strengthening their policy foundations, including supporting carbon emission measurement and reduction facilities [1], raising the need for introducing direct payments for climate change response [4], and proposing a 'Special Act on Strengthening Climate Crisis Adaptation and Resilience' [11]. Notably, a Carbon Neutrality Demonstration Support Center has opened in Seosan, Chungnam, to facilitate the spread of CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) technology processes [13, 14, 26, 33, 55]. Cities like Incheon and Suncheon are also moving to establish 'blue carbon' carbon sinks utilizing tidal flats and marine resources [9, 29, 51, 64, 68, 73, 74]. Various local governments, including Jeju Island, are operating carbon neutrality point systems that offer economic benefits for energy saving, thereby encouraging citizen participation [16, 24, 27, 39, 46, 47, 54, 70]. Daegu and Jeonju cities have solidified their status as leading carbon-neutral cities by achieving the 'highest rating' for two consecutive years in GCoM (Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy) [23, 35, 58].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Public Sector-Led Acceleration of Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "The domestic public sector has launched 'Public Institution K-RE100' to lead a major energy transition centered on renewable energy, setting a goal to expand the share of renewable energy to 60% by 2030 [77, 84, 92, 93, 97, 99, 102, 103]. The Ministry of Climate has established a 110 billion KRW fund to begin supporting renewable energy facilities and plans to reflect public institutions' solar and wind power usage performance in their management evaluations [102, 105, 106]. Several public institutions, including Korea Western Power and the Korea Sports Promotion Foundation, have declared their participation in K-RE100, setting an example for renewable energy transition [45, 76, 81, 98, 100, 101, 107]. Large-scale investments are also continuing in the Saemangeum region, where plans are underway to expand renewable energy generation capacity to a total of 10 GW [91, 108]. However, concerns have been raised that the full mobilization of public institutions in the process of expanding renewable energy could potentially harm the private sector [79], suggesting that balanced policy implementation is crucial.",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we examined concerns about the international community's retreat from climate policies, the intensifying impacts of climate change, and domestic efforts to actively pursue carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition in response. Addressing the climate crisis is a global challenge that requires continuous attention and effort. This concludes today's climate briefing."
