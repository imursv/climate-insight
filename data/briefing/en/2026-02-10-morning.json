        "title": "🔴 Winter Sports and Ecosystems in Crisis",
        "content": "Climate change is threatening the existence of winter sports worldwide. According to domestic and international reports, the 100-year tradition of the Winter Olympics is being shaken by snowless mountains and unstable venues [1, 4, 41]. Notably, in Cortina, a host region for the 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Olympics, rising temperatures have led to Olympic fans shedding their winter coats [75]. This warming trend places Olympic host cities on 'thin ice' [53, 70, 72, 76, 77, 85], and a significant reduction in snowfall across Europe suggests that climate change is reshaping landscapes [81]. Furthermore, warnings that areas suitable for raising cattle, sheep, and goats could halve by 2100 [51, 80], changes in the reproductive cycle of Mediterranean gorgonian corals [54], and alerts about hidden climate change disease threats [66] demonstrate widespread impacts on overall ecosystems and human health. In Egypt, warnings have been issued regarding drastic climate fluctuations during the Amsheer month [78], and in the UK, the vulnerability of flood defense systems was exposed due to record-breaking heavy rainfall [91], indicating a growing severity of climate disasters globally.",

        "title": "⚠️ Shadows Over Domestic Carbon Neutrality Goal Implementation",
        "content": "Concerns are mounting regarding the achievement of domestic carbon neutrality goals. While WWF acknowledged Korea's efforts in responding to the climate crisis, it assessed that goal setting remains opaque [6]. Specifically, the expansion plan for the Daejeon Combined Heat and Power Plant is criticized for potentially undermining carbon neutrality targets, as it is projected to increase greenhouse gas emissions tenfold from current levels [7, 13, 27, 44]. Furthermore, despite Incheon City's 2045 carbon neutrality target, criticisms have been raised about the inadequate implementation plans of local basic administrative units [9]. An opinion piece also highlighted the need for deep consideration of carbon neutrality practices in urban agriculture during the era of climate crisis [23]. Meanwhile, internationally, news reported by domestic media about Afghanistan experiencing its sixth year of drought and food shortages due to 'La Niña' is raising awareness of the global impacts of climate change [2, 8].",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Spreading Community-Centric Climate Action",
        "content": "Various local governments and institutions across Korea are actively moving towards climate crisis adaptation and carbon neutrality practices. Wando County has established its 3rd Climate Crisis Adaptation Plan, investing 203.9 billion KRW by 2030, covering coastal and fisheries sectors [3, 5]. Dongdaemun-gu launched a 'Carbon Neutrality One Team' in collaboration with 10 public, private, industrial, and academic institutions to promote everyday practices [10, 16, 24]. Haenam County aims to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and plans to break ground on a 38.9 billion KRW National Carbon Neutrality Edu-Center in the second half of this year [11, 12, 15, 17]. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups is encouraging industrial transition by recruiting companies for its 2026 SME Carbon Neutrality Equipment Investment Support Program [19, 20]. Similarly, diverse local communities and organizations, including Anseong City, Gwangyang City, and Asan City Council, are participating in climate crisis response through carbon neutrality resolutions and special committee activities [14, 18, 22]. Efforts for daily practices, education, and industrial transition are actively continuing, such as planned school carbon neutrality debates [21, 25] and the adoption of renewable energy and tree-planting initiatives by the metropolitan paper industry [28]. Incheon National University's RISE Project Group is leading the response to global ESG regulations and contributing to strengthening corporate climate change response capabilities [26].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Facing Challenges",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts for renewable energy transition are ongoing, but challenges are simultaneously emerging. Hanwha Energy is accelerating its penetration into the renewable energy market through a partnership with 'Chrysalis' [30]. Jeollanam-do is working to establish a foundation for global renewable energy talent settlement and to elevate Saemangeum into a global renewable energy hub [32, 33]. Notably, the 1.2GW Saemangeum Floating Solar Power Phase 1 project has been reignited with the goal of commercial operation by 2029, under the cooperation of various entities including Jeonbuk Province, Saemangeum Development and Investment Agency, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, and Korea Electric Power Corporation [35, 37, 38, 39, 40]. The top three domestic battery companies are focusing on expanding energy storage systems, betting big on the trillion-won ESS market [42]. GS E&C is also actively expanding into overseas markets, discussing participation in large-scale transmission network construction projects in Australia [43]. However, an paradoxical situation has been pointed out where renewable energy megaprojects are losing ground despite their 'eco-friendly' justification [29], suggesting the need for policy support and institutional improvements. Germany plans to reform its renewable energy grid connection system, shifting cost burdens to companies [31].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Crisis Response and Accountability",
        "content": "Discussions on climate crisis response and accountability are active within the international community. In Illinois, USA, legislation is being advanced to impose financial responsibility for climate change on corporations [49, 68], and a Southern Oregon senator is reintroducing a bill to make large oil companies pay for climate change disaster costs [64]. The Indian central government announced that Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana states are vulnerable to climate change impacts [83, 88], and reports explore the links between climate change, conflict, and migration, revealing complex crisis patterns [84]. In Canada, news emerged that 250 financial institutions plan to adopt exaggerated climate change data [82], and there's a growing recognition among insurers that climate change is just the tip of the iceberg [86]. On a positive note, progress is also seen at the corporate and city levels, with Kautex Textron achieving CDP Climate Change Leadership status [65] and the City of Cambridge being named an 'A' List city for its climate change work [87]. Concurrently, India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in collaboration with FAO - UN India, launched 'Harit-Sankalp,' the nation's first seed traceability digital platform, strengthening climate change adaptation efforts [89]. Argentina's nuclear plans and the resumption of uranium mining [92], along with IPBES's warning about nature loss [93], highlight the complex challenges of energy transition and ecosystem preservation.",

    "closing": "As the threats of climate change become a reality, various efforts to overcome them are emerging both domestically and internationally, alongside new challenges. It is time to continue stronger climate action through sustained attention and cooperation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
