    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and Unprecedented Damage",
        "content": "Throughout 2025, extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and storms have resulted in massive global economic losses exceeding $120 billion, according to one study [22]. In particular, the record-breaking Hurricane Melissa, which devastated Caribbean islands at 252 miles per hour in late October, summer wildfires in Spain and Portugal, and the June heatwave in the UK, clearly demonstrate the severity of the climate crisis [24]. Domestically, farmers who switched from apple to peach cultivation due to difficulties caused by climate change are now also facing hardships [1], and endangered penguins are considered the final warning of climate change [2]. These climate changes are directly impacting human health [23], and socioeconomic effects are also growing, with many people reporting increased living costs due to climate change [13]. Furthermore, rising snowlines are affecting national parks and the tourism industry, leading to the closure of 186 ski resorts in France, for example [20, 25].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Policy Challenges and Financial Barriers",
        "content": "Policy and financial challenges for responding to the climate crisis still persist. Domestically, concerns have been raised about the lack of consideration for carbon neutrality and the complete absence of related standards in events like 'light festivals,' which consume significant electricity [6]. Renewable energy is often 'treated like a side dish' (undervalued) socially, hindering its expansion [12]. Internationally, the US climate change response budget is being encroached upon by the defense budget [15]. The African continent is struggling with a financial gap for agricultural climate adaptation [17], highlighting the urgent need for support for adaptation efforts in climate-vulnerable nations. This situation aligns with the call for political honesty regarding the climate crisis [21].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Carbon Neutrality Practices and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Despite the challenges, positive progress and efforts to overcome the climate crisis are also continuing. Hankook Tire received an 'A' rating for two consecutive years in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) 'Climate Change Response' assessment, recognizing the company's climate action efforts [4]. Domestic local governments are leading the way in practicing carbon neutrality: Gwangju City has presented a vision to complete a self-sufficient city of 500,000 through carbon neutrality and has begun cooperation with the Korea Wood Culture Promotion Institute to operate a comprehensive carbon-neutral wood education center [7, 8]. Daejeon Yuseong-gu is contributing to carbon neutrality through its 'Carbon Footprint Excellent Apartment Certification' [9], and nationwide carbon neutrality practice cultural campaigns are being rolled out, encouraging citizen participation [10]. At the corporate level, POSCO is strengthening its future competitiveness by forming a 'squadron' (cluster/alliance) in the steel, materials, and carbon neutrality sectors [11]. Internationally, there are also movements to secure new adaptation funds, such as a federal judge upholding Hawaii's right to impose a climate change tax on cruise ship passengers [16]. Furthermore, the emergence of climate insurance that compensates for work stoppages during heatwave warnings is opening new horizons for climate change adaptation policies [5].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Climate Crisis Awareness and Search for Fundamental Solutions",
        "content": "Voices calling for a fundamental analysis of the causes of the climate crisis and the exploration of diverse solutions are also growing louder. Overpopulation and overconsumption have been pointed out as major causes of climate change [14], and an analysis has also emerged indicating that the aviation sector causes disproportionately significant damage [18]. Within this awareness of the problem, the opinion has been raised that political honesty regarding extreme weather is required for climate crisis adaptation [21]. Furthermore, discussions on the two perspectives regarding climate doom [3] reflect societal contemplation on how we should perceive and respond to the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have seen in today's briefing, the climate crisis is causing unprecedented damage, but at the same time, various efforts are being made both domestically and internationally to overcome it. Recognizing the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we must strive to create a better future through sustained policy efforts and the participation of civil society. This concludes today's climate briefing."
