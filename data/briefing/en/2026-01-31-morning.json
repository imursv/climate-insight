      {
        "title": "🌍 Headwinds and Skepticism in International Climate Policy",
        "content": "Significant challenges are being detected in policy efforts to address climate change within the international community. Particularly in the United States, a nominee for the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair under the Trump administration has indicated they would not consider climate change [27], and concerns have even been raised about the potential for banks to be steered away from climate action [28]. The news that the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on January 30, 2026, is causing significant concern for the international climate cooperation framework [46]. In the past, Trump mistakenly viewed record-breaking winter storms as evidence that global warming was a 'hoax' [43], and the invalidation of approximately 70 rules by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during his first year in office is pointed out as potentially harming ecosystem and climate protection [45]. Amidst these circumstances, New York State is seeking ways to protect clean water and prevent climate change despite federal headwinds [29].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Global Intensification of Extreme Weather Events Due to Climate Change",
        "content": "Globally, extreme weather events due to climate change are intensifying. In South Africa's Kruger National Park, scientists are linking extreme rainfall and floods to climate change [37], and Pakistan is also experiencing severe flood damage, serious enough to raise its voice at COP30 [36]. Sea-level rise presents significant challenges for coastal cities [30], and multi-scale modeling is being pursued to address this [26]. Australia experienced one of its most severe heatwaves on record [44], and in the U.S., snowstorms and Australian heatwaves occurred simultaneously [39], raising concerns that extreme winter weather could deepen misunderstandings about global warming [33]. The UK Met Office recalled 2025 as the warmest year on record for the UK, warning of the progression of climate change [49].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Expanding Climate Action Efforts by Domestic Local Governments and Businesses",
        "content": "Domestically, proactive efforts by local governments and businesses for carbon neutrality and climate change response are expanding. Yeosu City was selected as the final host city for the UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) Climate Week [2] and was welcomed by the city council [4], which will serve as an opportunity to highlight the importance of domestic climate action. Hwaseong Special City successfully promoted the Environmental Education City Carbon Neutral Forum [10], and Buyeo County Mayor, along with Chungnam-Daejeon, demonstrated their commitment to leading the carbon-neutral era through an 'Energy Economic Community' [9, 16]. Suwon Special City Council is strengthening the climate response capabilities of the local community by conducting on-site visits to the Climate Change Experience Education Center [6, 7] and the Carbon Neutral Green City creation project site [17, 18]. In the corporate sector, Hyundai Steel obtained a 'Leadership A-' rating for CDP Climate Change Response [5], and Hanjin is accelerating ESG management by building eco-friendly infrastructure for carbon neutrality implementation [15].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Acceleration of Energy Transition and Policy Dilemmas",
        "content": "As the energy transition accelerates to achieve carbon neutrality goals, various discussions and challenges continue both domestically and internationally. The Korean Nuclear Society argues that 'additional new nuclear power plants' are essential for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and responding to AI power demand [12], and the nuclear industry, academia, and research sectors have also pledged the core role of nuclear power in the carbon-neutral era [8]. In contrast, the documentary Newstapa presented the view that coexistence between renewable energy and nuclear power generation is difficult, also addressing the fear of blackouts [19]. In the renewable energy sector, practical application cases are increasing, such as LG Uplus signing a renewable energy PPA with GS E&C to transition IDC power [21], and 'RE100 tangerines' grown with renewable energy being launched [22]. While energy infrastructure has been emphasized as a key element of carbon neutrality and there have been calls to foster it as a major export industry [14], situations such as Pennsylvania needing to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without RGGI [34] and Europe not being on track to meet its 2030 offshore wind targets [48] indicate policy challenges.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 New Perspectives in Climate Science and Public Misconceptions",
        "content": "Scientific understanding of climate change continues to evolve, while public misconceptions also persist. Regarding the reduction of 'sulfur aerosols,' which were identified as a cause of climate change acceleration, new research suggests their impact is negligible, indicating the need for ongoing scientific discussion [1]. Meanwhile, a study on Americans' beliefs and attitudes towards climate change is scheduled for release in the fall of 2025 [25], which will serve as important foundational data for climate policy formulation. The observation that extreme winter weather can deepen public misunderstandings about global warming [33] emphasizes the importance of efforts to bridge the gap between scientific facts and public perception. The call for the cultural sector to lead a national dialogue on climate change through storytelling [42] is also highly significant in this context.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we have confirmed that despite challenges in international policy and the deepening global climate threat, various domestic and international actors continue their efforts in climate action. Enhancing scientific understanding and improving public awareness for climate change response are expected to become even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
