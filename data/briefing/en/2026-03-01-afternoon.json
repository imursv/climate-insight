      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening of the Climate Crisis and Widespread Impacts",
        "content": "Globally, the extreme impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly visible. In Japan, heatwaves reaching 40°C are becoming a common phenomenon [2], while in Australia, record high temperatures, prolonged droughts, fierce wildfires, and destructive floods have caused immense losses to wildlife and ecosystems [17]. According to a UN report, ten million people in Afghanistan were affected by climate change last year [15], and even Michelangelo's Vatican masterpieces are facing a situation where they are 'forced to undergo cosmetic surgery' due to climate change [16]. These reports clearly demonstrate that the climate crisis poses an all-encompassing threat to the natural environment, human lives, and even precious cultural heritage.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Domestic Carbon Neutrality Implementation and Global Cooperation",
        "content": "Domestically, proactive movements are being observed to achieve carbon neutrality goals. Gyeonggi Province has launched the '2nd Carbon Neutrality Citizen Promotion Group,' intensifying climate crisis response activities, conducting regional capacity-building training, and encouraging citizen participation [3, 5]. In the industrial sector, Dongkuk Steel is drawing attention for potentially becoming a game-changer in the carbon-neutral era with its 'Hyper Electric Arc Furnace' [4], and Hyundai WIA is accelerating towards its 2045 carbon neutrality target through electrification components and smart manufacturing [6]. Furthermore, LS Electric is boosting its power brokerage business by predicting renewable energy generation using AI [8], and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is contributing to global climate action by supporting Nigeria's climate finance capacity [1].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Global Green Energy Transition Trends",
        "content": "Across the globe, the transition to green energy is accelerating. China is transforming into the 'world's first electric nation' through its 'Green Energy Revolution' [7], which holds significant meaning as a leader in the global energy paradigm shift. In British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, renewable energy has also achieved new records, demonstrating continued growth in the renewable energy sector despite external challenges [14]. These advancements serve as a positive signal for achieving global carbon neutrality goals.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Analysis of Causes for Delayed Climate Action and Policy Challenges",
        "content": "Alongside in-depth analyses of the causes for delayed climate action, new policy challenges are also being raised. An analysis suggesting that fossil fuel companies' messaging strategies have influenced the delay in climate action serves as a reminder of past lessons [10]. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the climate costs that increased use of air conditioning (AC) systems will impose on global warming by 2050 [11], and experts are increasingly calling for an update to the list of climate change risks to avoid the worst impacts [12]. California's new climate change reporting rules are considered a significant step forward in enhancing corporate transparency regarding climate-related information [9], and the prediction that climate change will affect the wine industry, leading to more specific types of red wine in the future, foreshadows changes in our daily lives [13].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the severity of the climate crisis, while also demonstrating the coexistence of diverse domestic and international efforts to overcome it. Only sustained attention and action will be able to protect our future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
