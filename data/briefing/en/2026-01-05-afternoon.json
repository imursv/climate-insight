        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening Domestic Climate Crisis Response Organizations and Food Security",
        "content": "Today, domestic efforts to strengthen organizations for climate crisis response and ensure food security were prominent. The Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) established a new 'Climate Change Response Department' and elevated existing divisions to 'departments' to strengthen its dedicated organization for agricultural product supply and demand response, effectively addressing climate change impacting food supply [1, 3, 8, 11, 19, 22]. This is interpreted as a proactive measure to address the instability of food prices caused by the climate crisis [1]. Furthermore, Gangbuk-gu is strengthening its regional climate change response capabilities by establishing the '3rd Climate Crisis Adaptation Plan,' to be implemented from 2026 to 2030 [7]. The Republic of Korea also expressed its commitment to overcoming the climate crisis and doing its utmost to expand its food territory [30].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Policies and Investments to Accelerate Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "There was also news of expanded policy support and investment to achieve carbon neutrality goals. The Climate Response Fund has been transferred to the Ministry of Climate [12], which will directly manage a record-high 2.9 trillion KRW from the fund to accelerate carbon neutrality [37, 40]. Jeju Province plans to invest 17.4 billion KRW this year to transition into a carbon-neutral island with green hydrogen, and the CEO of Jeju Energy Corporation announced the goal of leading carbon neutrality by 2035 [38, 41]. KINTEX will host a platform to share technologies, policies, and achievements for carbon neutrality implementation [33], and local communities, such as Seogwipo City, are continuing their efforts by creating urban forests to expand the foundation for carbon neutrality [35, 39]. The energy transition is expected to enter an implementation phase starting in 2026, with the full-scale advancement of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and power market restructuring [47].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Renewable Energy and Technological Innovation",
        "content": "Various advancements have also been reported in the renewable energy sector. Jinan County plans to implement a basic income program funded 100% by county funds, utilizing profits from new and renewable energy [43]. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) will invest 11 trillion JPY over the next 10 years to accelerate decarbonization through nuclear and renewable energy [44]. Chungcheongnam-do Province, in cooperation with Samsung Display, is pursuing renewable energy installation projects utilizing idle public institution sites and producing solar energy in public institution parking lots, aiming for practical expansion [46, 55, 64]. The Korea Energy Agency (KEA) is laying institutional groundwork by inviting proposals for pilot projects utilizing off-site renewable energy for zero-energy buildings and initiating institutional experiments to recognize renewable energy generated outside buildings [48, 53]. Furthermore, Korea East-West Power (EWP) is focusing on strengthening renewable energy operational capabilities by conducting training for solar power practitioners, and Jeonbuk Development Corporation received an award from the Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy for its active promotion of new and renewable energy projects, demonstrating enhanced expertise and execution in the renewable energy sector [49, 50, 51, 62]. Iljin Electric signed a large-scale transformer supply contract with a US renewable energy developer, indicating increased participation of domestic companies in the global renewable energy market [63].",

      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Impacts of Climate Change and Current Challenges",
        "content": "Meanwhile, warnings about the severe impacts of climate change and the resulting challenges have continued. In Europe, ski resort usage fees have risen by 35% over the past decade due to a lack of snow [2]. Domestically, agricultural damage is becoming a reality, with programs like the 'Jangsu Apple Harvest Experience' being discontinued due to abnormal weather conditions [6, 26]. The Chairman of Nonghyup (National Agricultural Cooperative Federation) mentioned seeking solutions for climate change and rural aging issues, indicating difficulties in agriculture [23]. An analysis showed that increased car usage on rainy days leads to a corresponding rise in greenhouse gas emissions [32], and concerns were raised that carbon emissions are actually increasing despite the era of carbon neutrality [34]. An international climate organization identified last year's wildfires in the Yeongnam region as an unprecedented climate disaster, occurring once every 300 years, emphasizing the threat of climate change [65]. Furthermore, there was an international warning about increasing public health risks from amoebas linked to climate change [67].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Corporate Climate Change Response Efforts and Report Status",
        "content": "Corporate efforts to address climate change have also garnered attention. NH Investment & Securities received the highest rating, 'Leadership A,' in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change assessment, recognizing its efforts to address climate change [5, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31]. This demonstrates that the financial sector's sustainable management efforts are bearing fruit. However, despite 95% of sustainability reports from domestic listed companies addressing the impacts of climate change, it was pointed out that the specific content is still insufficient [4]. In this regard, Seongnam City Council plans to hold a 'Strategic Forum for Carbon Neutrality and Response to Product Carbon Regulations' on January 14 to explore ways for companies to effectively respond to climate change regulations [42].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the multifaceted domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis, alongside the severe impacts of climate change that we continue to face. Sustained policy support, technological innovation, and the active participation of all economic stakeholders will be key to overcoming the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
