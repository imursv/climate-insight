        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Crisis: Deepening Impacts and Urgent Warnings",
        "content": "In 2024, the global average temperature reached an all-time high, with warnings that it has surpassed the 1.5-degree Celsius climate change threshold [12]. Consequently, Asia became the biggest victim of climate change last year [6], and in Southern Africa, the combination of La Niña and climate change fueled catastrophic floods [48, 58, 75]. Destructive landslides are becoming more frequent in Alaska [53, 78], and analyses suggest that climate change is driving extreme weather patterns, both high and low temperatures [51]. China's average temperature broke records for two consecutive years, and Iraq was listed among the top five countries most affected by climate change [68, 84], demonstrating the accelerating global impact of climate change [86]. Furthermore, warnings have been raised about health and ecosystem threats, including the impact of climate change on the increase in malaria in Africa and on coastal waters and marine life [66, 79, 87].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Republic of Korea Takes Lead in Climate Action: Strengthening Domestic and International Leadership",
        "content": "Yeosu, Republic of Korea, has been confirmed as the final host city for the 2026 UNFCCC Climate Week, with the event scheduled for April [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 18, 21, 23]. This demonstrates Korea's strengthening international leadership in responding to climate change. Domestically, the Ministry of Climate has fully launched its carbon-neutral growth strategy and declared that the green transition will be a new growth engine starting in 2026 [5, 35]. Furthermore, the efforts of corporations are noteworthy, with a domestic steel company receiving the highest rating in climate change response [1], and another entity achieving a 'Leadership' rating in CDP climate change response [3]. At the local government level, Governor Kim Young-rok of Jeollanam-do proclaimed the 2050 carbon neutrality vision on the international stage [31], and resident autonomous councils in Sejong City and Gwangju Metropolitan City are encouraging active community participation through citizen-led low-carbon practices and carbon neutrality agreements [22, 27].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Renewable Energy and Green Technology Innovation: Key Drivers for Carbon Neutrality Transition",
        "content": "Both domestically and internationally, renewable energy transition and green technology innovation are actively underway. Korea East-West Power completed the construction of the nation's largest 'Jeju Bukchon Power Storage Plant,' contributing to overcoming the limitations of renewable energy [42], and the Gyeongsangnam-do Provincial Council passed an ordinance for installing new and renewable energy facilities in public parking lots and idle sites, establishing an institutional foundation for expanding renewable energy [43]. Corporate investments and technological developments are also continuing, with GS E&C entering the Indian new and renewable energy market [41], and LG Energy Solution compensating for sluggish EV sales with its ESS (Energy Storage System) business [47]. Notably, the news that 'RE100 tangerines' were cultivated using renewable energy for the first time nationwide showcases an innovative carbon-neutral practice in the agricultural sector [38]. However, despite the sufficient increase in renewable energy, grid issues and funding problems have been pointed out as challenges [39], and warnings have been issued that the global surge in gas power generation due to artificial intelligence (AI) demand could significantly burden the achievement of climate goals [89].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Governance and Resilience Building Efforts",
        "content": "The international community continues various policy discussions and legal actions to address climate change. The Dutch court's recognition of climate damage in a protectorate and its order for the government to establish a net-zero plan once again highlights the importance of climate litigation [10]. In the United States, climate change was a major agenda item at a gubernatorial candidate forum [49, 81], and critical discussions about former President Donald Trump's climate change policies are ongoing [50, 61]. Furthermore, local-level resilience-building efforts are underway, with the City of Seattle investing approximately $1 million to support communities most affected by climate change [65]. Interestingly, research has also shown that Svalbard polar bears exhibit remarkable resilience to climate change [52, 80], and the Arctic's 'deep water' is well-protected from climate change for the time being [55]. This suggests that climate change is manifesting in complex ways.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has once again underscored the severity of the global climate crisis, while also highlighting the simultaneous efforts of nations and domestic and international stakeholders towards carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition. Moving forward, prudent policy decisions based on scientific data and international cooperation will become even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
