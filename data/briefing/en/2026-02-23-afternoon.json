        "title": "🔴 Climate Change: Deepening Domestic and International Threats and Vulnerabilities",
        "content": "News released today warns that the domestic and international threats posed by climate change are intensifying. Domestically, if high carbon emissions continue, the Sobaeksan region is projected to experience extreme droughts 37.1 times more severe than current levels, threatening its ecosystem. Furthermore, the agricultural sector is facing difficulties due to climate change, and ski resorts are also confronting snow shortages and avalanche risks [1, 3, 10]. In the Southern Hemisphere, record-breaking heatwaves have led to 'climate disasters' and wildfire emergencies, while research suggesting that global grassland areas could be halved indicates a widespread ecological crisis [17, 93]. Additionally, the global fashion industry could face severe financial risks if it does not accelerate its response to climate change, and an analysis from the UK suggests that the surge in AI data centers is threatening the achievement of climate change goals [92, 98].",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts for Transitioning to a Carbon-Neutral Society",
        "content": "In response to this intensifying climate crisis, diverse efforts are actively being pursued domestically to transition to a carbon-neutral society. CMI's 'Super Green Vertical Garden' has successfully demonstrated its performance in responding to climate change, offering a new technological solution. In Jeju Island, carbon-neutral climate education is being provided to children, raising awareness among future generations [2, 7, 13, 30]. Local governments nationwide are actively recruiting participants for the 'Carbon Neutrality Point System,' which encourages citizens to practice carbon neutrality in their daily lives, such as reducing food waste and improving driving habits. Boryeong City is accelerating its transition from a coal city to a leading carbon-neutral city by commencing construction of a green hydrogen production base [19, 21, 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 46, 50, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60]. Additionally, ecological approaches are being pursued, such as exploring climate change responses through species conversion and facility relocation support in the aquaculture sector, and establishing Korea's first 'Semi-Mangrove Carbon Absorption Forest' in Jeju Island [4, 5, 8, 51].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 The Era of 100GW Renewable Energy: Power System Innovation and the Role of Corporations",
        "content": "The Republic of Korea is accelerating innovation in its power system, aiming for an era of 100GW renewable energy by 2030. The government plans to launch a 'Power System Innovation Task Force' and establish a 'Power Grid Innovation Plan' in the first half of the year to lay the groundwork for renewable energy integration [12, 61, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 72, 74, 76, 77, 79, 84, 87, 89]. Corporations are also participating in the renewable energy transition: Hankook Tire's Hungarian plant is accelerating its progress towards its 2050 net-zero goal by purchasing 430 GWh of renewable energy over 10 years, and KOSPO (Korea Southern Power Co.) is accelerating its renewable energy transition by constructing a hydrogen production base at its thermal power plants [80, 81, 82, 83, 85]. Internationally, a global movement towards expanding renewable energy is evident, with Egypt, for example, initiating a 500MW solar power tender to accelerate its renewable energy targets [71]. However, the renewable energy usage by some domestic steel companies remains negligible, raising concerns about supply chain regulations [73].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Responding to Climate Change: The Importance of Cooperation and Policy",
        "content": "Responding to climate change requires not only technological efforts but also a societal consensus and international cooperation. Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik emphasized that carbon-neutral policies must be pursued based on public consensus and presuppose the guarantee of future generations' rights. There was also a point made that a shift towards 'performance-oriented' approaches is necessary in the era of carbon-neutral budgets [24, 28, 29]. The 2026 CDP Korea Conference is scheduled to be held under the theme of 'Climate Change and the Transition of Businesses, Industries, and Finance.' Efforts to strengthen policy governance are also ongoing, with various local governments, including Hongseong County, soliciting and launching Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth Committees [9, 22, 25, 34, 44, 45, 52]. In the international community, there is active movement emphasizing the value of cross-border cooperation, with Kyrgyzstan establishing a joint committee with Korea for climate change cooperation, and Australia launching a space project with India to address climate change [99, 101, 102]. Economists also share a common understanding of climate change, and awareness of its widespread impacts is spreading, with analyses suggesting that climate change is shaping the performance of specific industries, such as the olive oil sector [94, 96].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have confirmed in today's briefing, climate change poses a serious threat across our entire society. However, at the same time, continuous efforts are being made in technological innovation, policy formulation, and international cooperation to overcome it. Through sustained interest and participation, we must work towards creating a sustainable planet for future generations. This concludes today's climate briefing."
