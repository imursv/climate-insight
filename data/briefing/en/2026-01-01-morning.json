        "title": "🔴 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Domestic and International Warnings",
        "content": "2025 was a year when extreme weather events intensified globally due to climate change [41]. In the United States, record-breaking heatwaves and catastrophic storms occurred, with global warming and biodiversity loss directly impacting individuals' lives [59]. Domestically, clear warnings of climate change are being observed, with heatwave occurrences doubling and tropical night occurrences quadrupling over the past 113 years [3]. These phenomena demonstrate the severe impacts on global ecosystems and human health, including rising temperatures in Amazonian lakes [42], the amplification of Minnesota blizzards by climate change [40], and research linking climate change to increased emergency room visits for childhood asthma [37]. As early as 2005, Alexander Downer warned of severe climate change consequences [34, 56], and we are now facing a complex crisis where these past warnings are becoming reality [58].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Domestic Energy Transition and Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Domestically, efforts for energy transition to achieve carbon neutrality goals are accelerating across all sectors. Taean Thermal Power Unit 1, which had been operating for 30 years, ceased power generation, signaling the full-fledged start of the renewable energy transition [10, 29], and Minister of Climate Kim Sung-hwan announced that regulations hindering the expansion of renewable energy would be boldly improved [18]. The government is taking full precautions in establishing the carbon-neutral energy mix basic plan, emphasizing the harmony between renewable energy and nuclear power [4], and Korea Western Power, as an innovative company leading a carbon-neutral future, is undertaking concrete actions such as supplying renewable energy to Soonchunhyang University campus [7, 19]. Local governments, including Seoul Metropolitan City and Yongin Special City, are strengthening community-level efforts by developing carbon-neutral practice programs [6] and selecting the best green complexes [13]. Furthermore, awareness and participation towards carbon neutrality are spreading across society, with Shinseong E&G Chairman Lee Wan-keun publishing the book 'Energy Transition in the Era of Climate Change' [1] and the mechanical equipment industry emerging as a key player in the carbon-neutral era [8].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Challenges in the Energy Transition Process and Necessity for Policy Responses",
        "content": "Amidst the acceleration of energy transition, new challenges are emerging. The phenomenon of 'power black holes' is occurring due to the surging electricity demand from Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to warnings that a full mobilization of all energy sources, including nuclear power, renewable energy, and hydrogen, is necessary [17]. Germany is suffering from power bottlenecks despite increasing wind and solar power generation, and Spain also faces a shortage of energy storage facilities, indicating the importance of infrastructure expansion as renewable energy expands [28]. In Chungcheongnam-do, Korea, the necessity for continuous management through city/county-specific mapping of climate response projects has been raised, demonstrating the importance of efficient policy implementation and management [2]. Similar to the content of an SF novel mentioning dust-covered solar panels [30], careful consideration of long-term management and sustainability is required, not just technological adoption.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Action, Legal Responsibility, and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "The international community is attempting various approaches to address climate change, but political responses remain insufficient, as evidenced by the COP30 meeting concluding with a 'hollow agreement' due to oil-producing nations hindering progress on phasing out fossil fuels [51, 57]. However, movements to establish 'climate justice' are active in courts worldwide, with 13 climate litigation victories in 2025 alone, leading to significant decisions such as the decommissioning of fossil fuel power plants and amendments to climate plans [32, 55]. Meanwhile, despite policy setbacks at the federal government level, climate change response measures are progressing at the city and state government levels [38], and technological innovation and civil society participation continue, including research to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete production [39] and tree seedling donations by women engineers [54]. Furthermore, practical community-level adaptation efforts are noteworthy, such as new 'mini-bridges' in Canada's Paulatuk region helping hunters adapt to climate change [52].",

    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the severity of the climate crisis, along with diverse domestic and international response efforts, and the challenges that need to be addressed. Through continued attention and cooperation, we must work towards building a more sustainable future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
