        "title": "⚠️ International Climate Crisis Warnings and Policy Conflicts",
        "content": "Warnings about the severe impacts of climate change continue globally. According to a UN report, a grim outlook suggests that 1.1 billion people could be exposed to hunger by 2100 if no action is taken now [59]. Furthermore, the warming climate is even eroding cultural traditions like the Lunar New Year, and changes are being observed in natural ecosystems and industries, such as the emergence of new white wine varieties due to climate change [60, 61]. Amidst this crisis, the Trump administration is pressuring the International Energy Agency (IEA) to 'abandon carbon neutrality,' intensifying energy policy conflicts between the U.S. and Europe, which is expected to pose difficulties for the international community's joint response [17].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Adaptation Efforts: Marine and Fisheries Sector",
        "content": "Domestically, support projects in the marine and fisheries sector are being actively promoted as part of climate change adaptation efforts. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries is soliciting and implementing the '2026 Pilot Aquaculture Support Project for Climate Change Response' to prepare for climate change damage to aquaculture farms [1, 3]. Through this project, it will support species conversion and facility relocation for aquaculture farms, investing a total of 3.2 billion won to select 16 sites [2, 4, 5]. This is an important step to proactively respond to changes in the marine environment due to climate change and to support the sustainable livelihoods of fishers.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Spreading Community-Centered Carbon Neutrality Practices",
        "content": "Community-centered carbon neutrality efforts are spreading across the nation. Daedeok-gu, Daejeon, is actively launching carbon neutrality projects in 12 districts, seeking solutions to the climate crisis in everyday life [9, 12, 19, 22, 25]. Cheongsong-gun is accelerating its environmental administration with the goal of 'realizing Cheongsong as an Oxygen Cafe beyond the climate crisis' [6]. Various local governments, including Pohang City, Gyeongju City, and Cheongsong-gun, are recruiting participants for the Carbon Neutrality Point System (for vehicles), encouraging citizens' voluntary greenhouse gas reduction [8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24]. Furthermore, various stakeholders from the political sphere and local communities, such as the launch ceremony of the Democratic Party's Suwon-jeong Carbon Neutrality Committee and Jinju City's accelerated green initiatives, are actively participating in responding to the climate crisis [18, 28].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition by Corporations and Local Governments",
        "content": "Efforts by corporations and local governments to transition to renewable energy are also accelerating, serving as a crucial factor in strengthening their global ESG corporate standing [7]. In particular, Hankook Tire's Hungarian plant has signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 430 GWh of renewable energy, accelerating its net-zero strategy by replacing 20% of the plant's electricity with solar-based renewable energy over the next 10 years [10, 27, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57]. In addition, positive signs for the spread of renewable energy are emerging, such as a 27% drop in battery costs last year [33]. Domestic local governments, including Gochang-gun and Jung-gu, are also accelerating renewable energy supply projects and supporting household solar power facilities, aiming to improve energy self-sufficiency and reduce costs [32, 36, 53]. Furthermore, the economic value of the renewable energy sector is being highlighted, with investments in rooftop solar power showing an annual profit structure of 9-11% gaining attention [56, 58].",

      }

    "closing": "Today's briefing demonstrates that diverse response efforts are continuing both domestically and internationally, even amidst the severity of the climate crisis. We must strengthen climate resilience through sustained interest and participation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
