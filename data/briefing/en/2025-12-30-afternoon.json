        "title": "🔴 Urgent Climate Crisis Warning and its Domestic and International Severity",
        "content": "Extreme climate phenomena are intensifying both domestically and internationally [18, 92, 93, 94], clearly demonstrating the acceleration of global warming. Domestically, abnormal weather conditions such as heatwaves are causing a double burden for farming households, leading to increased facility investment costs and decreased production [1, 13, 17], and this year's wildfires in the Gyeongbuk region were also attributed to climate change [3]. In particular, in South Korea, the reality of the climate crisis is clearly proven by data, with the number of heatwave days increasing 2.2 times and tropical nights more than 4 times over the past 113 years, alongside more frequent torrential downpours [11, 19, 20, 21]. Internationally, cases of forced village relocation due to climate change have already occurred in Fiji and Tuvalu [95, 99], and economic damages are spreading, such as a 14% decrease in wine harvest in Portugal [96]. This climate crisis is having a severe impact across our society, including causing mental distress known as 'eco-anxiety' [102].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Status and Policy Challenges",
        "content": "According to the 'Analysis Report on 113 Years of Climate Change in Korea' published by the Korea Meteorological Administration, climate change on the Korean Peninsula has accelerated, with summers lengthening by 25 days and winters shortening by 22 days over the past 30 years [2, 9, 14]. This is a result of the annual average temperature rising by 1.9 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years, and particularly by 0.9 degrees Celsius in the last decade, leading to a surge in heatwaves and tropical nights [2, 11, 19]. The importance of policy implementation to respond to such climate change is emphasized, and there is also a forecast that 2026 will be a turning point determining the success or failure of carbon neutrality [7, 55]. Meanwhile, amidst the debate over nuclear phase-out, the Minister of Climate pointed out that South Korea's share of renewable energy is at the bottom among OECD countries [71], and raised the necessity for public discourse on energy policy, including the utilization of nuclear power, to achieve carbon neutrality [79, 84]. Discussions are actively underway regarding the inevitability of combining renewable energy and nuclear power, with scenarios presented that project nuclear power's share at 25% alongside an energy mix strategy primarily focused on renewable energy by 2050 [78, 82, 83].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Expansion",
        "content": "Various local governments and companies in South Korea are actively striving for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Sinan County has opened a Carbon Neutrality Support Center, officially launching its 2050 carbon neutrality implementation system [27, 28, 47, 51], and cities like Gwangmyeong, Anseong, and Yongin Special City are also promoting carbon neutrality practices and accelerating green growth [22, 24, 25, 34, 35, 38, 46, 56, 61]. In particular, Korea Western Power, in cooperation with Soonchunhyang University, has embarked on building a carbon-neutral eco-friendly campus through the dissemination of renewable energy [23, 26, 45, 49, 64, 65, 68, 77, 81, 86], and Icheon City is working to expand renewable energy, including signing an MOU for the creation of an RE100 industrial complex [76]. Furthermore, modular construction and net-zero buildings are emerging as solutions for carbon neutrality in the building sector [44, 52], and ZEST Co., Ltd. was selected for the Ministry of SMEs and Startups' TIPS program to accelerate carbon-neutral AX in the building sector [41]. The National Chuncheon Forest Recreation Center is leading carbon neutrality by developing eco-friendly products using fire-damaged timber [58], while organizations such as the Dongdaemun Cultural Foundation, Seongju-gun Youth After-School Academy, and Cheongju Sugok Elementary School Fathers' Association are encouraging citizens to practice resource circulation and carbon neutrality through educational and experiential activities [39, 42, 43, 50, 53, 67]. In 2025, the Ministry of Climate and Energy was launched, declaring the expansion of renewable energy [70, 75], and private sector participation is also active, with 'Vuna,' the largest renewable energy company in the Asia-Pacific, holding a charity bazaar in Korea for climate-vulnerable groups [74].",

      {
        "title": "🌍 International Community's Climate Response and New Trends",
        "content": "2025 is expected to be recorded as a 'new era of climate extremes,' with extreme climate phenomena intensifying globally [92, 93, 94]. In response, the international community is making various policy efforts; in Hawaii, a climate change tax is scheduled to be implemented on hotels and cruise ships to secure funding for climate change response [91]. Australia is operating the world's first climate change visa program for Tuvaluans facing submersion, offering a practical solution to the climate refugee issue [99], and is also contributing to Vietnam's climate change response efforts [100]. The European Union (EU) is setting an example for renewable energy transition, with renewable energy accounting for 25.2% of its final energy consumption in 2024 [72]. Furthermore, the role of educational and research institutions is being emphasized, with models like the Cli-Res Living Lab, where university campuses mitigate climate change and assist urban tree cover through interdisciplinary cooperation, being demonstrated [98]. China is emerging as a key player in achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 [31], and the impact of climate change response on the global economy is also growing, with copper prices surging due to the skyrocketing demand for renewable energy and AI [85].",
