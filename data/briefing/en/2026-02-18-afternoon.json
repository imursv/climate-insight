      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis: Warning for 3-Degree Warming and Widespread Impacts",
        "content": "European climate scientists have advised the international community to prepare for a 3-degree global temperature increase, exceeding the Paris Agreement targets, and warned that economic damages from climate change have reached 77 trillion KRW annually over the past five years [1, 7, 35]. While climate change is accelerating, the pace of nature is slowing down [37], and widespread concerns are growing, with nearly half of Americans expecting to witness catastrophic impacts of climate change in their lifetime [40]. In particular, climate change has emerged as a global health issue [50], enabling tropical diseases like Chikungunya to spread across most parts of Europe [69], and coffee agriculture is facing an increase in extreme heat days [66].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Crisis in International Climate Governance: U.S. Policy Reversal and International Repercussions",
        "content": "The United States has signaled significant repercussions for the international climate order by officially announcing the repeal of greenhouse gas regulations by former President Trump and indicating a potential withdrawal from the International Energy Agency (IEA), stating that 'carbon neutrality is not necessary' [4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 22]. The Trump administration claimed that climate change does not threaten public health and stripped the EPA of its climate change-related authorities, but the scientific community refutes these claims [43, 48]. This U.S. policy reversal is interpreted as a turning point for the Republican Party, which refers to climate change as a 'hoax' [47], and poses a serious challenge to the international community's collective response efforts.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Domestic and International Climate Action and Green Jobs",
        "content": "Jobs related to climate change response are projected to increase by an average of 3.6% annually until 2032, adding a total of 118,000 positions, indicating that the climate crisis response industry is expected to be a significant driver for future job creation [2, 3, 6]. Domestically, community efforts to foster eco-friendly green generations are active, such as Yangcheon-gu's operation of the 'EGG Expedition' [11], and the Chuncheon Carbon Neutrality Support Center is highlighting the importance of local areas in achieving carbon neutrality by inviting proposals for policy support research projects [14, 20]. Companies are also participating in carbon neutrality efforts; S-OIL, for example, is accelerating its eco-friendly initiatives by accumulating 1.68 million carbon neutrality points through the issuance of electronic receipts [15, 17, 19, 23, 24]. Furthermore, positive progress is seen in the education sector, with a new law enacted in Illinois mandating climate change education for high school students [49].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Expansion of Renewable Energy and Efforts to Build Sustainable Infrastructure",
        "content": "Domestically, alongside the easing of regulations for renewable energy installation [25], on-site direct power transactions for renewable energy have begun at Daebul Industrial Complex, realizing a model that directly supplies power to businesses [26, 27, 31]. Jeollanam-do Province has secured all 2 trillion KRW worth of government bids for ESS (Energy Storage System), raising expectations for easing renewable energy output control [29]. Suwon City is also continuing community-level renewable energy transition efforts, such as promoting the 'Apartment RE100 Rooftop Solar Pilot Project' [32]. Shinhan Bank is contributing to building sustainable infrastructure through 'Productive Finance' cooperation with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, expanding financial support in data centers and new and renewable energy sectors [28, 33, 34]. Furthermore, Okcheon County is set to open the Daecheongho Lake waterway for the first time in 42 years and operate the eco-friendly electric boat 'Jeong Jiyong-ho,' which will serve as an excellent example of introducing eco-friendly transportation [36].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Diverse Impacts of Climate Change and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Climate change is having diverse impacts worldwide. A study showing that the impact range of extreme rainfall in Valencia, Spain, expanded by 55% due to climate change demonstrates the severity of climate disasters [39, 45]. The cement industry is facing challenges such as reduced shipments, carbon neutrality goals, and rising electricity costs [18], and a lake in Japan is showing warnings of gradual climate change [53]. Meanwhile, adaptation efforts in ecosystems are being reported, such as wolves observed consuming bones to cope with climate change [52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 67]. City-level preparations for change are also underway, with the Point Arena City Council considering revising its general plan in the wake of climate change [61].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis, alongside various domestic and international efforts and adaptation cases to overcome it. This is a critical time when strong international cooperation on climate change and concrete actions for a sustainable future are more urgently needed. This concludes the climate briefing for February 18, 2026."
