    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🔴 International Climate Policy and Domestic Crisis Warnings",
        "content": "In today's briefing, we will first examine the international community's stance on climate change response and various crisis signals detected both domestically and internationally. An international human rights organization warned that the United States' withdrawal from international organizations would lead to human rights violations and increased climate change risks, contrasting with the positions of other governments advocating for a clean energy transition [1, 66]. Domestically, there is a strong call for urgent long-term and strategic climate change response policies [6], and the unprecedented large-scale wildfires in January have been attributed to a complex combination of human factors and climate change [8]. Furthermore, the worst power outage in a decade due to climate change has been reported internationally, raising awareness of the immediate impacts of the climate crisis [64].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Challenges and Policy Proposals for Domestic Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Next, we will address the significant challenges faced during the domestic renewable energy transition and various proposals to overcome them. It has been pointed out that achieving the 100GW renewable energy target is impossible with the current transmission grid alone and difficult without a regionally-led power market transition [31, 36, 39, 40, 41, 46, 58]. In particular, there is strong industry opposition to the move to include 'air heat' as renewable energy [33], and a contradictory situation is observed where connection restrictions occur simultaneously with efforts to expand renewable energy [40]. In response, political circles, including Representative Kim Jung-ho, are seeking solutions by proposing the introduction of a government-led 'Renewable Energy Contract Market System' and a bill to promote the development, utilization, and dissemination of new and renewable energy [43, 47]. Meanwhile, North Korea is encouraging the use of renewable energy such as solar and wind power to resolve its chronic power shortages [34, 37], and internationally, detailed adjustments to renewable energy policies are being made, such as Japan Life Insurance excluding renewable energy operators causing local issues from their procurement sources [61].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expanding Domestic and International Practices for Carbon Neutrality and Climate Adaptation",
        "content": "In the third section, we introduce various positive domestic and international efforts for climate change adaptation and achieving carbon neutrality. Numerous local governments and organizations in Korea are undertaking concrete actions such as disseminating new agricultural technologies in response to climate change [2, 5, 9, 10], disaster prevention projects [3], and training carbon neutrality action groups [14, 25]. In particular, the Korea Rural Community Corporation is fully committed to proactively securing agricultural water in preparation for droughts [15], and the Yeongsan River Basin Environmental Office is promoting the creation of energy-independent 'Sunshine Income Villages' based on renewable energy [20, 23, 30, 38]. In the corporate sector, HMM is leading the way in carbon neutrality by introducing the 'Wing Sail' wind-assisted propulsion system [26], the OCP Group is accelerating towards its 2040 carbon neutrality target through solar power generation [72], and StarHub has shown positive results, including achieving an 'A' rating in the CDP climate change assessment [70]. Furthermore, international renewable energy projects are also progressing smoothly, with Pacifico Energy commencing commercial operation of its wind farm in Vietnam [53, 54, 56, 57, 59]. Alongside these efforts, scientists are also exploring innovative adaptation measures such as developing 'antacids' for the ocean and protecting climate change refugia [63, 65].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Multifaceted Impacts of Climate Change and the Search for Future Strategies",
        "content": "Finally, we will examine discussions on the widespread impacts of climate change and the search for future strategies. Socioeconomic discussions are active, with proposals on the impact of climate change on migration and livelihood resilience being released [67], and a long-term perspective on the climate crisis and carbon neutrality is being emphasized through the significance of 2026 and a review of 2025 [21, 68, 69]. Domestically, the importance of carbon-neutral steel and Pohang's role are highlighted [24], and it was noted that AI and carbon neutrality are not an either-or issue but a complex challenge requiring a complete redesign of power infrastructure and market structures [16]. Meanwhile, changes in energy policies in various countries are drawing attention, such as China mandating the on-site use of renewable electricity produced in industrial complexes [50], and news that Japan's famous ski destinations are transforming due to climate change suggests impacts on the tourism industry [71]. Alongside this, the potential for converting cattle and pig manure into renewable energy [42] and the unexpected environmental issue of eco-friendly wet wipes increasing sewage treatment costs [62] illustrate the complex and multifaceted aspects of responding to climate change.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "The international policy changes and diverse climate change response efforts, both domestic and abroad, discussed in today's briefing highlight the complexity of the challenges we face, as well as the importance of a multifaceted approach to their resolution. This concludes today's climate briefing for January 12, 2026. Thank you."
