      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis: Far-Reaching Impacts and Warnings",
        "content": "The reality of the climate crisis is having widespread impacts both domestically and internationally. The ski industry in the Gangwon region is facing an existential crisis due to climate change, with a sharp decline in operating days and visitors [1, 2, 9, 10, 14]. Domestically, 108 deaths have occurred due to heatwaves, and the number of heatwave and tropical night days is increasing, warning that an era where seasons become disasters has arrived [8, 15]. Internationally, the list of potential host regions for the Winter Olympics is rapidly shrinking due to climate change [39, 40, 45, 46, 47, 49, 51, 54, 55, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 70, 71]. Global food prices have risen by 280%, and forest loss due to wildfires has doubled compared to 20 years ago, making severe threats visible [68, 76]. Furthermore, in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions have increased for the first time in three years due to cold snaps, data centers, and fossil fuel combustion, reversing previous reduction trends [74, 75], reaffirming that climate change is one of the major global risks [43].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Republic of Korea Accelerates Climate Response and Carbon Neutrality Transition",
        "content": "Amidst these crises, the Republic of Korea continues its efforts to respond to climate change and transition to carbon neutrality. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has earned the highest rating in urban climate crisis response assessments for four consecutive years, being recognized as the nation's sole 'global honor student' [4, 7, 13]. Jeju agriculture is fully committed to climate change response and digital transformation [5], and Mungyeong City is investing 226 billion KRW in disaster prevention projects [6], demonstrating active climate action by various local governments. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is promoting a 250 billion KRW corporate-participatory carbon neutrality support project [16, 17, 19], and changes across society are being observed, such as the expansion of the role of voluntary disaster prevention teams beyond disaster response to include carbon neutrality [12]. Boryeong City's declaration of its RE100 vision and the promotion of a carbon-neutral leading model for the International Garden Expo are positive signals for achieving domestic carbon neutrality goals [21, 24].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Renewable Energy Expansion and Policy Challenges",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts to expand renewable energy are also active. South Korea has been appointed as the President of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Assembly for the first time, gaining an opportunity to demonstrate global leadership [25, 29]. Domestically, energy public enterprises are reporting the development of large-scale renewable energy projects in gigawatt units [26], and a plan to reduce state-owned property rental fees for new and renewable energy projects by up to 80% is being pursued, which is expected to ease site acquisition [27, 28, 34, 36]. In the agricultural sector, efforts to improve farmers' incomes through renewable energy utilization continue, with the largest ever national budget secured for new and renewable energy facility support [30, 32]. However, the push to close thermal power plants in Chungcheongnam-do is causing a conflict between 'carbon neutrality' and 'economic impact' [22], and there are also challenges requiring careful consideration and coordination during the policy implementation process, such as equipment manufacturers expressing dissatisfaction with the government's renewable energy policies [37].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Action and Research Trends",
        "content": "The international community continues various approaches and research to address climate change. Navigator Company and ReNew have achieved the highest 'A' rating in the CDP climate change assessment, demonstrating corporate climate action leadership [48, 53], and the Trees4Adapt project is addressing climate change and biodiversity loss risks through tree-based solutions [50]. Furthermore, future generations are actively participating in climate action, with UACh students attending the COP30 climate change conference in Brazil [52]. Meanwhile, President Marcos urged reforms in climate change and sustainable development finance, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation [72], and Thailand is exploring carbon neutrality pathways through international energy cooperation [73]. However, the case of a mandatory climate change education bill being repealed in New Jersey suggests that continuous international attention and effort are needed regarding the importance of climate education [41].",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "Through the reality of the climate crisis discussed in today's briefing, the various domestic and international response efforts, and the challenges that need to be addressed, we are once again reminded of the urgency of climate action. This concludes today's climate briefing."
