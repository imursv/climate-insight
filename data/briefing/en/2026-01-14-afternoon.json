        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and Global Warnings",
        "content": "According to recent reports, 2025 was the third hottest year on record, and analysis indicates that global warming has reached 1.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels [145, 169]. Rising sea temperatures suggest that this is a result of heat storage due to global warming [148], and reports continue to indicate that global warming is accelerating worldwide [150]. Domestically, the frequency of winter wildfires is increasing, with 17 wildfires occurring in January alone [144], and extreme climate disasters are becoming a reality, with 108 deaths due to heatwaves [14]. In this situation, urgent measures to prevent environmental destruction and climate change are essential [167], and concerns have been raised that the United States' withdrawal from climate change response represents a retreat in human survival management [4]. Notably, the U.S. saw an increase in carbon pollution in 2025, reversing previous declines [170], raising concerns that the global climate action gap remains significant [164].",

        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Response and Adaptation Efforts",
        "content": "Domestic adaptation efforts to climate change are manifesting in concrete forms. Gwangju City in Gyeonggi Province has begun cultivating tangerines inland in response to climate change [1], and innovative approaches are gaining attention, such as 'Cellopharm,' a climate change response product, being selected as an innovative product by the Public Procurement Service [5, 12]. Furthermore, the 'Climate Change Response Agency' has been launched to safeguard food security amidst the climate crisis, strengthening national-level adaptation capabilities [9]. Seoul Metropolitan Government earned the highest A-grade for four consecutive years in the Urban Climate Crisis Response Evaluation [6, 11, 16] and was recognized as the nation's sole 'global honor student,' presenting a model case for urban-level climate crisis response. Song Young-il, President of the Korea Climate Change Society, emphasized that the core of climate change response is 'implementation,' and stressed the importance of practical action, stating that both mitigation and adaptation are facing a crucial test of their executability [2].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Investment and Policies for Accelerating Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy plans to actively support companies' green transition by promoting carbon neutrality support projects worth 250 billion Korean Won this year [21, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 46, 47, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 64, 67, 77, 80, 82, 87, 90]. Korea East-West Power is strengthening corporate-level efforts, including accelerating energy transition to achieve '2050 Carbon Neutrality' and hosting expert seminars [22, 23, 24, 39, 41, 44, 45, 61, 66, 75, 76, 83]. Local governments are also undertaking various initiatives, with Gwangmyeong City opening the 'G-Smart Hub,' a carbon-neutral smart city base [18, 19, 20, 37, 72, 73, 74, 81], and Gimhae City operating carbon-neutral experiential programs [27, 70]. In particular, Gyeongsangnam-do Province has secured 3 billion Korean Won in its carbon neutrality point budget this year, encouraging residents to practice carbon-neutral living [29, 43, 48, 69, 79, 85, 89, 93]. Private sector participation is also active, with Kolon Industries accelerating towards its 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by establishing 2.4MW solar power generation facilities at its Gumi plant [17, 84, 91, 92, 94, 141, 142, 143].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 The Light and Shadow of Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Korea Western Power has shared a roadmap to significantly expand its renewable energy facility capacity to 13.5GW by 2040, accelerating projects primarily focused on offshore wind and solar power [96, 99, 101, 104, 105, 107, 109, 110, 129, 130, 132, 133, 136, 138]. Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water) is also promoting the expansion of water resource-based renewable energy, planning to increase its renewable energy facilities tenfold within five years and reviewing pumped-hydro storage development [97, 108, 127, 140]. However, strong opposition is emerging, particularly from the geothermal industry, regarding the policy to designate air-source heat pumps as renewable energy, stating that 'classifying electricity-consuming facilities as renewable energy distorts the concept,' thus necessitating policy discussions [98, 103, 106, 114, 115, 117, 120, 125]. Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea has been nominated as the chair country for the next International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Assembly, gaining an opportunity to demonstrate international leadership in the renewable energy sector [121, 122, 131]. Furthermore, institutional foundations for expanding renewable energy dissemination are being established, including plans to reduce national property rental fees by up to 80% to broaden the scope of renewable energy projects [102, 113, 124].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Strengthening Climate Change Research and International Cooperation",
        "content": "At the National Assembly, a 'Digital Safety Management Forum for Facilities in Response to Climate Change' was held, chaired by Professor Choi Dong-ho [7], and interest from policy-makers and academia continues, with the current state of climate crisis response being discussed at the 30th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention [8]. Internationally, a Canada-Sweden Arctic expedition led by the University of Calgary provided profound insights into climate change, once again highlighting the importance of climate research [161]. Reports that Malaysian insurers are recognizing long-term risks due to climate change demonstrate that climate change is also significantly impacting the financial sector [162]. Discussions on how climate change will reshape the Winter Olympics explore its impact on sports and culture, allowing for predictions of broader societal changes [146, 153, 154, 156, 159]. Efforts to find response strategies tailored to each country's unique environment are also active, such as Bhutan's proposals for climate change impacts and response strategies [3].",

    ],
    "closing": "As you have seen in today's briefing, while the threat of climate change is growing, various efforts and research to overcome it are continuously underway both domestically and internationally. Continued attention and action will be crucial going forward. This concludes today's climate briefing."
