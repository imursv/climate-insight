      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Discussions on Domestic Policies and Climate Crisis Response",
        "content": "Domestically, policy discussions and on-site inspections for climate crisis response are actively underway. Notably, public discourse has begun as the deadline for amending the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act, which received a 'non-conformity to the Constitution' ruling, is approaching. This will be a crucial turning point for achieving domestic carbon neutrality goals [4]. The Suwon City Council's Environment and Safety Committee and Urban Future Committee have visited sites such as the municipal waste transfer station, the Climate Change Experience Education Center, and the Carbon Neutral Green City development project site, exploring practical measures for climate change response [1, 5]. These movements once again emphasize the urgency and importance of domestic climate policies.",

      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Impacts of Climate Change and Future Threats",
        "content": "Globally, warnings about the direct impacts and future threats of climate change continue to emerge. The 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics face a situation where they will have to rely on artificial snow due to the climate crisis, raising concerns about the future of winter sports [2]. California's iconic Highway 1 in the United States is also experiencing difficulties due to climate change, exposing the vulnerability of social infrastructure [10]. Furthermore, one study warned that over 120 million additional malaria cases could occur in Africa by 2050, predicting the severe impact of climate change on human health [11].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Domestic and International Efforts for Carbon Neutrality Transition",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts to transition to carbon neutrality to overcome the climate crisis are accelerating. Domestically, Taean County is actively commencing the overhaul of its agricultural infrastructure to respond to the climate crisis, while Jeungpyeong County and Goyang City are accelerating towards carbon neutrality by extensively promoting electric and hydrogen vehicle dissemination projects starting in 2026 [3, 6, 7]. Internationally, Vietnam's Khanh Hoa province aims for a major transformation into a national energy hub encompassing renewable energy, nuclear power, and LNG [8]. Aspen One has demonstrated private sector contribution by funding climate change research in Colorado [9]. Furthermore, CDP recognized Toyo Tires' carbon reduction efforts by selecting them for the Climate Change A List [14], and a movement has been observed where some meat enthusiasts are limiting beef consumption through 'Beef Day' to reduce climate impact through personal dietary changes [17].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Expanding Climate Change Discourse and Raising Awareness",
        "content": "Social discourse and public awareness regarding climate change are expanding in various ways. The Suwon City Council visited the Climate Change Experience Education Center, confirming the importance of citizen education [1]. Riggin Stonebarger is expanding her scope of activities through climate change speeches [12]. Frances Coaster emphasized the need to understand the difference between climate change and global warming, raising the necessity of accurate information dissemination [13]. King Charles III was praised for his approach to climate change at a documentary premiere, demonstrating high-level interest and influence [15]. Conversely, Booker Prize winner George Saunders posed the question, 'Who wants to read climate change fiction?', prompting reflection on how climate change issues are presented to the public [16].",

    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the urgency of the climate crisis, alongside the diverse domestic and international efforts underway to overcome it. In-depth discussions and concrete actions on climate change must continue. This concludes today's climate briefing."
