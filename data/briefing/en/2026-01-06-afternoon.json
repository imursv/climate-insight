    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🌍 Strengthening Korea-China Environmental and Climate Cooperation",
        "content": "South Korea and China have agreed to further strengthen environmental cooperation and comprehensively respond to climate change and the circular economy [1, 2, 7]. This marks a significant advancement, as it involves revising the 'Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental and Climate Cooperation' between the two countries, expanding the scope of cooperation from fine dust to climate change and the circular economy [9, 12, 26]. Climate Minister Kim Seong-hwan announced plans to enhance environmental and climate cooperation with China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment to promote green transition and carbon neutrality [12, 21]. This is interpreted as a positive signal for joint responses to climate change in the East Asian region.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Climate Crisis, Domestic and International Warnings",
        "content": "The severity of climate change is becoming increasingly clear both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the Yeongdong region is on the front lines of climate change, facing numerous environmental issues [3], and the frequent occurrence of floods and droughts due to climate change necessitates the revision of the 'Framework Act on Water Management' [16]. Notably, Jeju and the Chungnam region experienced unprecedented climate change last year, recording their second hottest year on record [19, 27]. Similarly, 2025 also saw consecutive records broken for heatwaves and tropical nights, marking it as the second hottest year on record [28]. These phenomena are turning the warning 'the climate crisis has become an everyday reality' into a tangible truth [30, 31]. Internationally, concerns are being raised that climate change could lead to health issues such as migraine induction [71] and an increase in deadly brain-eating amoebas [76], as well as human rights issues [77].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Strengthening Domestic Systems for Climate Change Response and Shifting Corporate Awareness",
        "content": "Domestically, the strengthening of systems for climate change response and responsible corporate actions are becoming prominent. The Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) has upgraded its existing 'Climate Change Response Department' to the 'Climate Change Response Bureau' and strengthened its role as a control tower to fully address the food climate crisis [6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17, 22, 29]. This is considered an important measure to respond to uncertainties in agricultural product supply and demand and to stabilize food prices. Furthermore, Kumho Petrochemical Group is strengthening its environmental management and actively responding to climate change [4], and the improved level of climate change disclosure by domestic listed companies indicates a heightened specific awareness of climate risks [5, 15]. NH Investment & Securities demonstrated a leading role by achieving the highest rating, 'Leadership A,' in the CDP Climate Change Response assessment [23]. Practical responses at the local government level are also continuing, with Suncheon City, for example, securing a budget of 1 billion KRW to support fruit farmers in preparation for abnormal weather conditions [25, 32, 33, 34].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating the Transition to a Carbon-Neutral Society",
        "content": "Various efforts to transition to a carbon-neutral society are accelerating across the nation. Yeoncheon County has signed a business agreement with Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental Studies for cooperation in carbon neutrality and sustainable development, officially commencing joint research on a locally-led carbon-neutral model [35, 42, 43, 46, 50]. Cheonan City is strengthening community capabilities by launching training courses for carbon-neutral citizen experts [37, 45, 47, 49], and Gimhae City is also training resource circulation interpreters to promote carbon-neutral practices in daily life [38]. Sokcho City is leading the implementation of carbon-neutral policies through an agreement on the recycling of forest by-products [40], and Chungcheongnam-do has launched its 4th Environmental Education Committee, demonstrating its commitment to leading carbon neutrality [51]. Alongside these efforts, the Korea Energy Agency and Korea National Railway are promoting nationwide competitions and pilot projects for carbon neutrality [48], indicating comprehensive efforts are underway.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Trends in Renewable Energy and Eco-Friendly Technology Innovation",
        "content": "Positive progress and active discussions are also taking place in the fields of renewable energy and eco-friendly technology. In 2026, the adoption of heat pumps is expected to accelerate through the establishment of their status as renewable energy in the market [55], and efficient energy use methods are expanding, including the recognition of external renewable energy utilization in zero-energy buildings [58]. In Jeollanam-do, discussions are underway regarding renewable energy generation methods utilizing the sea and fields [54], and the necessity of a 'citizen benefit' approach for solar power on public idle land [62]. Concurrently, ways for small modular reactors (SMRs) and renewable energy to coexist are also being explored [57]. Furthermore, new challenges for decarbonization finance are emerging, such as the expansion of ESG bond investment targets beyond renewable energy to 'building efficiency' [59]. SK On is contributing to the development of eco-friendly energy storage solutions through ESS technology development and business cooperation [65]. Such domestic and international technological innovations [72] will be a crucial driving force in responding to climate change.",
        "tone": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As discussed in today's briefing, the climate crisis is becoming a reality. However, simultaneously, active response efforts are continuing through international cooperation, the strengthening of domestic systems, and technological innovation. We hope that all these efforts will be important steps towards a sustainable future. This concludes today's climate briefing."
