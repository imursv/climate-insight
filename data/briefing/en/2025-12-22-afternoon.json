        "title": "🔴 Severe Warning on the Future of Domestic Climate Change",
        "content": "The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has expanded and reorganized its 'Climate Change Status Map,' which provides an overview of climate change in Korea upon global average temperature rise, issuing specific warnings about future climate crises [1, 3, 4, 10, 15, 16]. According to this map, under a high-carbon scenario (SSP), Seoul's winter is projected to last only 12 days annually starting from 2081. By 2100, Seoul's temperatures are expected to exceed 40℃, with heatwaves reaching 119 days and tropical nights 112 days [1, 107]. The impacts of climate change are already materializing, with 2025 projected to see the second-highest heatwave record in history [5]. Specific damages are already evident, including deepening food losses due to increased agricultural pests [11], the issuance of a drought 'attention level' for the Neopdo area of Wando-gun, and a 16.4% decrease in reservoir levels [23, 25]. This situation demonstrates that climate change is no longer a distant future concern but is profoundly impacting all aspects of our lives.",

      {
        "title": "🌱 Expanding domestic and international efforts to achieve carbon neutrality",
        "content": "Various efforts are underway by domestic and international companies and local governments to achieve carbon neutrality. TAIYO YUDEN was selected for the highest rating, the 'A List,' in the CDP Climate Change program for four consecutive years [8], and HL Mando received international approval for its 2035 greenhouse gas reduction target [24]. Shinhan Bank participated in the nationwide carbon neutrality project '2026 Net Zero Challenge X' and has begun supporting climate tech startups [31, 35, 40, 41, 42, 47, 52, 60, 65, 66, 71], while the Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth plans to support investment and demonstration for early-stage climate tech companies through an integrated announcement of next year's projects [62, 68, 70]. Several local governments, including Seosan City, Gumi City, Haenam County, and Buyeo County, are actively promoting carbon neutrality policies such as creating eco-friendly cities, expanding low-carbon agriculture, and operating energy-independent shelters [9, 17, 18, 20, 22, 28, 29, 38, 45, 49, 55, 56, 59, 61, 63, 69], and Hyundai Motor and Kia are also supporting the carbon-neutral transition of the automotive industry supply chain through public-private cooperation [58].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating the Transition to Renewable Energy and Policy Support",
        "content": "Domestically, the transition to renewable energy is accelerating, accompanied by robust policy support. The news that solar and wind energy have surpassed fossil fuel energy for the first time marks a significant milestone in the energy transition [76]. The government provides electricity bill benefits for installing solar power facilities on factory roofs, marking the first step towards achieving the 100GW renewable energy target by 2030 [84, 85, 90, 102, 103, 104]. Jeonbuk Development Corporation, as the first local public enterprise, is initiating a renewable energy electricity supply project using an 'on-site direct PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)' model, thereby presenting innovative models [81, 87, 89, 92, 96]. The government and ruling party have declared the acceleration of the renewable energy transition and are fully embarking on the promotion of the 'Special Act on Renewable Energy Self-Sufficient Cities' [88, 95, 101]. Positive market changes are also being observed, with related companies expected to benefit from the surge in domestic RE100 (100% renewable energy use) demand [93]. However, alongside claims that renewable energy alone is insufficient to meet energy demand, the necessity of a rational 'energy mix' policy is being raised [74], and challenges for efficient implementation, such as the replicability of the Jeju Gapado wind power experiment [97], still remain.",

      {
        "title": "🌍 The Global Threat of Climate Change and the International Community's Response",
        "content": "Climate change poses a global threat, prompting the international community to heighten its awareness. Research has revealed that the Arctic region is undergoing chemical changes, thereby accelerating climate change [108], and investors are increasingly concerned about the threat that unpredictable weather phenomena pose to clean energy [109]. In her inaugural Christmas message, Irish President Catherine Connolly highlighted climate change as a critical agenda item alongside war, emphasizing the necessity of international solidarity [112]. Moreover, with revelations that climate change is influencing how people decide whether to migrate or remain in their current locations [113], it is fundamentally impacting human lifestyles and survival. As Türkiye prepares to host COP31, discussions are underway to review the key achievements of COP30 [110], illustrating the international community's continuous pursuit of cooperation to address climate change.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we reviewed severe future warnings concerning domestic climate change, alongside various domestic and international efforts for carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition, and the global climate crisis situation. Responding to climate change is no longer an option but a necessity, and only continuous attention and action can protect our future. This concludes today's climate briefing."

Specifically, the map projects that if the global average temperature rises by 2℃, the number of tropical nights in Seoul could quadruple by 2050, and by 2100, temperatures in Seoul could frequently exceed 40℃. Under the most severe scenario, by the end of the 21st century, Gangnam Station could experience 112 days of extreme heat and zero winter days.",
        "cause": "These climate changes are attributed to the rise in global average temperatures, and it has been specifically noted that if fossil fuels continue to be used, the number of tropical nights is projected to increase to 85 days.",
        "outlook": "In 2050, Seoul's tropical nights are projected to double, and by 2100, 'sweltering nights' are expected to reach 85 days. The climate change status map will be utilized to predict future climate changes, such as regional heatwave and cold snap days, resulting from global temperature rise."
