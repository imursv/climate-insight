        "title": "🔴 Severe Future Warnings for Domestic Climate Change",
        "content": "The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) has expanded and reorganized its 'Climate Change Status Map,' which provides an at-a-glance view of climate change in Korea when global average temperatures rise, issuing specific warnings about future climate crises [1, 3, 4, 10, 15, 16]. According to this map, under a high-carbon scenario (SSP), winters in Seoul are expected to last only 12 days annually starting from 2081, and by 2100, Seoul's temperature is projected to exceed 40℃, with heatwaves lasting 119 days and tropical nights 112 days [1, 107]. The impacts of climate change are becoming a reality, with 2025 expected to record the second-highest heatwave on record [5]. Specific damages are already evident, including deepening food losses due to increased agricultural pests [11], the issuance of a drought 'attention stage' in the Neopdo area of Wando-gun, and a 16.4% decrease in reservoir levels [23, 25]. This situation demonstrates that climate change is no longer a distant future concern but is profoundly impacting all aspects of our lives.",

        "title": "🌱 Expanding Domestic and International Efforts for Carbon Neutrality Implementation",
        "content": "Various efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are continuing among domestic and international companies and local governments. TAIYO YUDEN has been selected for the highest 'A List' rating in the CDP Climate Change category for four consecutive years [8], and HL Mando has received international approval for its 2035 greenhouse gas reduction targets [24]. Shinhan Bank has participated in the nationwide carbon neutrality project '2026 Net Zero Challenge X' to support climate tech startups [31, 35, 40, 41, 42, 47, 52, 60, 65, 66, 71], and the Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth plans to support investment and demonstration for early-stage climate tech companies through an integrated project announcement for next year [62, 68, 70]. Various local governments, including Seosan City, Gumi City, Haenam County, and Buyeo County, are actively pursuing carbon neutrality policies such as creating eco-friendly cities, expanding low-carbon agriculture, and operating energy-independent shelters [9, 17, 18, 20, 22, 28, 29, 38, 45, 49, 55, 56, 59, 61, 63, 69]. Hyundai Motor and Kia are also supporting the carbon-neutral transition of the automotive industry supply chain through public-private cooperation [58].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition and Policy Support",
        "content": "In Korea, the transition to renewable energy is accelerating, with active policy support. The news that solar and wind energy have surpassed fossil fuel energy for the first time marks a significant milestone in energy transition [76]. The government has taken the first step towards achieving the 100GW renewable energy target by 2030 by offering electricity bill benefits for installing solar power facilities on factory rooftops [84, 85, 90, 102, 103, 104]. Jeonbuk Development Corporation is also presenting innovative models, such as commencing the first 'on-site direct PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)' renewable energy supply project among local public enterprises [81, 87, 89, 92, 96]. The ruling party, government, and presidential office have declared an acceleration of the renewable energy transition and are actively pursuing a 'Special Act on Renewable Energy Self-Sufficient Cities' [88, 95, 101]. Positive market changes are also observed, such as an expected increase in benefits for related companies due to a surge in domestic RE100 (100% renewable energy use) demand [93]. However, arguments suggest that renewable energy alone is insufficient to meet energy demands, raising the need for a rational 'energy mix' policy [74]. Challenges for efficient implementation also remain, such as the replicability of the Jeju Gapado wind power experiment [97].",

      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Threat of Climate Change and International Response",
        "content": "Climate change is a global threat, and the international community is raising awareness of it. Research results have been published indicating that the Arctic region is undergoing chemical changes, accelerating climate change [108], and investor interest is growing regarding the threat of unpredictable weather phenomena to clean energy [109]. Irish President Catherine Connolly emphasized climate change as a critical agenda alongside war in her first Christmas message, stressing the need for international solidarity [112]. Furthermore, it has been revealed that climate change is influencing how people decide whether to migrate or remain in their current locations [113], fundamentally impacting human lifestyles and survival. As Türkiye prepares to host COP31, discussions are underway to review the key achievements of COP30 [110], demonstrating the international community's continuous pursuit of cooperation to address climate change.",

      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we have examined the severe future warnings regarding domestic climate change, various domestic and international efforts for carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition, and the global climate crisis situation. Responding to climate change is no longer an option but a necessity, and only sustained attention and action can protect our future. This concludes today's climate briefing."

This map predicts that if the global average temperature rises by 2℃, the number of tropical nights in Seoul will quadruple by 2050, and Seoul's temperature could exceed 40℃ by 2100. Under the worst-case scenario, the number of heatwave days at Gangnam Station could reach 112, and winter days could be zero by the end of the 21st century.",
        "cause": "Such climate change is attributed to the rise in global average temperatures. It was also mentioned that if fossil fuels continue to be used, the number of tropical nights is projected to increase to 85 days.",
        "outlook": "By 2050, tropical nights in Seoul are projected to double, and by 2100, 'sultry nights' are expected to reach 85 days. The Climate Change Situation Map will be utilized to predict future climate changes, such as regional heatwave and cold wave days resulting from rising global temperatures."
