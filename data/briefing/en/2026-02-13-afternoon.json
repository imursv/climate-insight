        "title": "🔴 U.S. Climate Policy Faces Significant Retreat",
        "content": "The most notable news today is that the U.S. Trump administration has withdrawn from climate change response efforts and officially abolished the basis for greenhouse gas regulations [1, 6, 16]. This involves the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversing its 'endangerment finding' for greenhouse gases and divesting itself of climate change regulatory authority. By dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations, it is being criticized as 'the greatest climate policy regression in U.S. history' [14, 20, 33, 118, 119, 125]. This decision was made in disregard of scientific evidence, denying the threat of climate change to public health and foreshadowing a wave of lawsuits [120, 122, 123, 132, 137, 140, 165, 168]. Former President Obama warned that such policies would make the U.S. 'less safe' [139], and environmental activists are strongly protesting and vowing to appeal [149]. Some have projected that this measure will incur costs of 4.7 trillion dollars, alongside criticism that it is a gift to 'billionaire polluters' [27, 183].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Acceleration of Domestic Renewable Energy Transition and Policy Improvement",
        "content": "Domestically, positive movements to expand renewable energy are active. The UN Climate Change Convention Secretary-General emphasized that renewable energy is a key means for establishing energy sovereignty and security [2], and the National Assembly passed an amendment to the Renewable Energy Promotion Act, significantly easing regulations on the separation distance for solar and wind power generation facilities [72, 77, 78, 83, 88, 92]. This clarifies the legal status by separating 'new energy' and 'renewable energy,' laying the groundwork for expanding renewable energy supply [81, 85]. Efforts towards renewable energy transition are also continuing in the corporate sector, with SK Group pursuing the restructuring of its new and renewable energy businesses and the establishment of joint ventures [84, 90, 95, 96, 106, 116], and LS Electric building solar-linked energy management solutions for companies to implement RE100 [102, 104, 107, 108, 114, 117]. Furthermore, KEPCO KDN is strengthening international cooperation by signing an MOU with the Senegalese Renewable Energy Agency for mutual cooperation in energy ICT [98, 110].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Carbon Neutrality Efforts and Climate Research by Korean Local Governments and Institutions",
        "content": "Across the nation, various efforts are being made to achieve carbon neutrality. Pohang City held promotional briefings to attract the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP), aiming to spread consensus [3, 4, 7, 13, 15], and Choi Jae-chul, Director of the Climate Change Center, was awarded the French National Order of Merit, recognizing his contributions to climate change response [5, 10]. Siheung City has launched 'Siheung Carbon Household Plus,' a citizen-participatory carbon neutrality practice app, to encourage carbon neutrality in daily life [39, 40, 41, 58, 67, 68, 75], and Gwangmyeong City aims for carbon-neutral urban regeneration through support for old housing repairs [44, 49, 52, 64, 69, 73]. Furthermore, the National Arboretum is strengthening 18 years of climate change research by linking it with 'citizen science' [11, 30], and Anseong City in Gyeonggi Province is working to establish a scientific foundation, including promoting the development of waxy corn varieties resistant to climate change [12]. In addition, policy and institutional support efforts, such as strengthening the legal basis for climate and environmental education, expanding the carbon neutrality budget, and plans for establishing a voluntary carbon market exchange, are also being actively discussed [46, 59, 60].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Global Climate Threats and Domestic and International Impacts of Climate Change",
        "content": "The impacts of climate change are spreading globally, causing concern. In California, USA, poisoning incidents have surged due to an increase in poisonous mushrooms caused by climate change [8], and domestically, the instability of supply and demand for major fish species is deepening, directly affecting ecosystems and the economy [22]. Furthermore, in Central Asia, climate change is leading to an increase in agricultural water usage [150], and globally, climate change is causing topographical changes, with 3,100 glacier surge events being tracked [142]. In this situation, warnings are being raised that current discussions on greenhouse gas reduction will place a heavy burden on future generations [25, 62]. Meanwhile, in Australia, scientists have raised concerns that the approval of coal mine expansion will exacerbate the climate crisis [181], and in Florida, proposals to prohibit local governments from enacting climate change policies are emerging, indicating backward movements in climate change response in some regions [141].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "In today's briefing, we have addressed the significant concern regarding the rollback of climate policies in the United States, alongside the multifaceted efforts to expand domestic renewable energy and achieve carbon neutrality. As the threats of climate change become increasingly real, international cooperation and responsible actions from each nation are more critical than ever. This concludes today's climate briefing."
