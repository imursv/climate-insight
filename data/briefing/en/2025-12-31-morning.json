        "title": "🔴 Intensification of the Climate Crisis on the Korean Peninsula and Globally",
        "content": "On the Korean Peninsula, the climate crisis is rapidly accelerating, with heatwaves doubling and tropical nights increasing by 4.2 times over the past 113 years [2, 4, 7, 10]. Summers are becoming 25 days longer and winters 22 days shorter, showing a clear trend of blurring seasons [36], and these extreme weather events are now becoming 'permanent climate' [7]. Internationally, scientists have warned that 2025 was so hot that the Earth has already surpassed a critical climate change tipping point [39], and extreme weather is intensifying globally, with Iceland recording its warmest December 24th ever [66, 50]. Criticism has also been raised that 'no one is listening' despite nature's strong warnings about climate change [60], once again highlighting the urgency of the crisis.",
        "tone": "urgent"

      {
        "title": "⚠️ Widespread Impacts and New Challenges of Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change is clearly delineating crop-specific damage patterns in the agricultural and rural sectors [8], and disrupting ecosystems by altering migratory bird schedules, leading to an increase in 'bird strikes' [5]. It also directly impacts food safety, necessitating urgent proactive responses to environmental hazards [3], and is having widespread effects across industries and daily life, such as the worsening snow shortage in European ski resorts [45]. Concerns about the future are growing, with warnings that climate change could incur enormous costs for businesses [43], and reports indicating that it is pushing human adaptive capacity to its limits [47, 50]. Notably, the observation that a new crisis, 'digital climate change,' is not being discussed [54] highlights the complexity of the challenges we face.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Carbon Neutrality Goals and the Reality of Energy Transition",
        "content": "Domestic and international efforts towards the 2050 carbon neutrality goal are ongoing, but the implementation process is expected to face changes in the industrial landscape and new challenges [14]. It has been suggested that achieving carbon neutrality requires a harmonious balance of four elements: technology, economy, society, and politics [11], and while the 2050 renewable energy targets have been presented, criticism has arisen due to the lack of disclosed electricity tariff information [26, 33]. Public discourse on the energy mix and the construction of new nuclear power plants has begun [21, 34], and arguments have been made that expanding renewable energy, alongside a mix of various energy sources such as nuclear power, LNG, hydrogen, and ESS, is necessary for carbon neutrality [23]. Civil society is urging for responsible plans in the 12th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand to fill the void left by coal power with renewable energy [29], posing profound questions about South Korea's energy future [22].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts and Progress in Responding to Climate Change",
        "content": "Domestically, institutional efforts are continuing, with Jeonbuk Self-Governing Province holding a TF meeting on agricultural and rural climate change response [1], and the government establishing proactive national climate crisis response measures [9]. Specific examples of carbon neutrality implementation by businesses and local governments are increasing, such as Western Power and Soonchunhyang University signing an MOU to establish a carbon-neutral eco-friendly campus [12, 13, 25, 30], and Icheon City promoting the creation of an RE100 industrial complex [32, 16, 18, 19, 20, 24, 31]. The 'Korean Green Taxonomy' has been expanded and revised to include 100 items, such as renewable energy and heat pumps [28], laying the foundation for promoting eco-friendly investments, and policy support, such as the proposed legislation to alleviate electricity costs for aquaculture and support renewable energy [27], is also active. In the international community, new laws addressing climate change issues are expected to be enacted in 2026 [41, 49, 51, 56, 58, 61], there are top 10 countries that are adapting fastest to climate change [53], and hopeful efforts for recovery and adaptation are continuing worldwide, with African journalists adopting a dual role in responding to climate change [64, 62].",

    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the severity of the climate crisis, alongside the reality of diverse domestic and international efforts coexisting to overcome it. Through continued attention and cooperation, we must effectively respond to climate change. This concludes today's climate briefing."
