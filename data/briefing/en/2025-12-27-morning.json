      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and Widespread Impacts",
        "content": "Today, we face the widespread impacts brought about by the climate crisis. Domestically, the crisis for species like endangered penguins is deepening [2], and even farmers who switched from growing apples to peaches due to climate change are now struggling [3, 4]. Furthermore, amidst concerns about climate catastrophe, warnings have emerged that coastal damage could become severe not only along the west and south coasts but also in the Seoul metropolitan area [6, 7]. Internationally, there is growing concern about how climate change is deteriorating economic viability and threatening human rights [25, 26], and particularly, U.S. voters are directly linking the climate crisis with rising inflation [28, 44]. These changes are leading to mental health issues such as 'eco-grief' [31], and global disasters like heavy rainfall and lake flooding in Kenya [35], and extreme weather events such as the record-breaking Hurricane Melissa [45] are further exacerbating its severity.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Efforts for Carbon Neutrality and Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "Amidst this crisis, various efforts to achieve carbon neutrality goals are continuing domestically. Geochang County has demonstrated its status as an 'environmental city' by achieving results in carbon neutrality, waste management, and eco-tourism [11, 14], and Yongin City is directly visiting companies to guide them on measures for achieving carbon neutrality [13]. Jeollanam-do Province has secured 210.3 billion KRW in national funding to proactively respond to economic downturns and strengthened carbon neutrality regulations [16], and Gyeongsangbuk-do Province is leading the era of carbon neutrality with Pohang City designated as a specialized distributed energy zone [17]. Furthermore, Mungyeong City was selected for a new and renewable energy convergence support project, securing national funding [20, 23], and the Korea Power Exchange is continuing efforts for renewable energy technology development, including field demonstration of 'synthetic inertia control' technology for wind turbines [24].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 International Climate Action and Adaptation Strategies",
        "content": "The international community is also exploring various actions and adaptation strategies to combat climate change. Kauai County in the U.S. is strengthening its local response by adopting a climate change action plan [27], and in the Milwaukee area, various stakeholders, including youth, churches, and grocery stores, are showing engagement in climate action [37]. Researchers have identified and mapped 'climate change safe havens' that are more resilient to warming, presenting the possibility of gaining crucial decades [30], and researchers worldwide are accelerating the development of scientific solutions, such as discovering genes to secure food supplies [42]. In addition, international cooperation and efforts to overcome the climate crisis are continuing, with Turkey demonstrating a move to exert international leadership by nominating its climate change minister as the COP31 president [40].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Complexities and Challenges in Climate Crisis Response",
        "content": "However, in the process of responding to the climate crisis, complex challenges that still need to be addressed remain widespread. Domestically, despite an abundance of renewable energy generation, 'green waste' occurs where generated electricity is discarded due to transmission grid bottlenecks, hindering the efficiency of energy transition [19]. Internationally, understanding of climate change within the U.S. is shaped by factors such as skepticism, dogmatism, and personal experience [34], and some even liken those expressing concerns about climate change to 'Grinches,' revealing differences in perception [32]. African nations, in particular, are deeply concerned about the enormous financial gap for climate adaptation in the agricultural sector [33], highlighting the urgent need for support and improved awareness in vulnerable regions.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severe reality of the climate crisis, along with various domestic and international efforts to overcome it, and the challenges that still remain. This is a time when sustained attention and proactive action are becoming even more crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
