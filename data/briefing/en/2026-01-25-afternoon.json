      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Impacts of the Climate Crisis and International Warnings",
        "content": "Globally, alarm bells are ringing about the intensifying direct impacts of climate change. Recent research indicates that heatwaves in Australia are 5 times more likely to occur due to climate change [24], and in Chile, wildfires in extreme heat have claimed 21 lives and displaced numerous people [25]. Domestically, endemic plants on Hallasan Mountain, such as *Hanlasomdali* (Saussurea chionophylla) and *Ammae* (Diapensia lapponica var. obovata), are facing a severe crisis due to climate change [2], and the assertion that the fall of the Tang Dynasty was caused by climate change rather than rebellion suggests the historical significance of the climate crisis [5]. Furthermore, questions are being raised about whether climate change is weakening the polar vortex, and Nigerian farmers are expressing concerns about the impact of climate change on staple food crops [20, 21].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Growing Domestic Awareness of the Climate Crisis and Policy Directions",
        "content": "Domestically, public awareness of the climate crisis appears to be significantly increasing. Seven out of ten Chungbuk residents, or 70%, showed interest in the climate crisis, a 14.6 percentage point increase from the previous year [4, 6]. This heightened awareness aligns with discussions on the nature of the climate crisis and the role of citizens, as highlighted by Kim Yeon-jun, Director of the Climate Restoration Practice and Culture Institute [7]. Meanwhile, research also suggests that knowing the public consensus on climate change does little to promote people's behavioral support, indicating the importance of policy approaches that go beyond mere awareness-raising to induce tangible behavioral change [23]. Accordingly, there are calls for carbon neutrality policies to be systematically pursued at the regional level [8].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts and Innovations for Carbon Neutrality Implementation",
        "content": "Concrete efforts to address the climate crisis and achieve carbon neutrality are actively underway both domestically and internationally. In Korea, deep-sea blue carbon off the East Coast of Gyeongbuk has been proposed as a potential solution for Korea's carbon neutrality [9], and there are calls for agricultural management to be adaptively tailored to the times, in response to climate change and an aging population [3]. Jecheon City is supporting the transition of businesses to carbon neutrality by hosting a 'Carbon Neutrality and Corporate Response Strategies Workshop' and establishing a cooperation system with the Jecheon-Danyang Chamber of Commerce and Industry [10, 11, 13]. Gwangju City is recruiting 'Green Leaders' for its Carbon Neutrality Citizen Promotion Group, encouraging citizen participation [12]. Furthermore, the 2025 Experiential Learning Symposium is scheduled to feature student presentations on various topics, including climate change preparedness, emphasizing the role of future generations [22].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Challenges and Opportunities in Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy is a crucial challenge and opportunity globally, yet it simultaneously faces several hurdles. Domestic companies are experiencing difficulties in procuring renewable energy and are demanding improvements to the PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) system [14]. In Korean society, an 'energy polarization' phenomenon is observed, where preferences for nuclear and renewable energy are divided along political lines [16]. However, amidst these challenges, there are also positive developments, such as Jeonbuk Provincial Assembly member Seo Nan-yi hosting a forum on introducing agrivoltaics to expand renewable energy and presenting a vision to make Jeonbuk a hub for renewable energy and future industries [15, 17]. The European Union (EU) is also supporting the promotion of renewable energy development, bolstering the transition [18]. However, new issues are emerging in places like China's Shandong Province and Germany, where 'negative electricity prices' – a phenomenon where power generators must discard electricity due to excessive renewable energy production – are becoming commonplace [19].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the urgency of the climate crisis, along with various domestic and international efforts and challenges for carbon neutrality and renewable energy transition. As awareness of the importance of climate action grows, it must be accompanied by tangible policy improvements and technological innovation. This concludes today's climate briefing."
