        "title": "🔴 Climate Crisis: Threatening Daily Life and Nature",
        "content": "Recent events occurring domestically and internationally clearly demonstrate the severe impact of climate change on our daily lives and nature. Domestically, climate change is directly impacting livelihoods and culture, with declining fish catches, erratic crop flowering seasons, and even disruptions to local festivals [2]. Internationally, destructive wildfire damage has been reported, such as the Longwood bushfire in central Victoria, Australia, which engulfed numerous homes and livestock [24]. In the Marin region of the United States, despite recent floods, negative perceptions of climate change still persist [21]. Furthermore, the psychological and social repercussions are growing, with anxiety about the climate crisis even leading to an individual's decision regarding abortion [25]. Bill Gates has warned of the potential failure to address climate change and urged strong government policy intervention [8].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening Domestic Climate Change Adaptation and Research Capabilities",
        "content": "In response to this crisis, the Republic of Korea is accelerating efforts to strengthen its climate change adaptation strategies and expand research capabilities. The National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) is strengthening national-level research infrastructure by reorganizing its mid-to-long-term research system and establishing comprehensive plans to actively respond to climate change [1, 4, 5]. Local governments are also making specific adaptation efforts. Jeju Province is fully committed to climate change response by changing major crop varieties to suit the changing climate and promoting the digital transformation of agriculture [3, 6, 9]. Gangwon Special Self-Governing Province is building safe coastal and port areas in preparation for climate change [7], and Pyeongchang County is expanding its irrigation facility support project to prepare for droughts, thereby developing adaptation measures tailored to local characteristics [10].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Energy Transition and Reduction Efforts for Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "In addition to adaptation efforts, domestic energy transition and carbon emission reduction initiatives are being pursued in various ways to achieve carbon neutrality. SK is entering the Gumi Carbon Neutral Industrial Complex and participating in the second bidding for the ESS Central Contract Market, leading the expansion of energy storage systems in the private sector [11]. In local communities, Dongshin University and Naju Daesil Village have signed an agreement to resolve regional issues related to energy transition and carbon neutrality, establishing a win-win cooperation model [12]. Seoul National University, the top carbon emitter among single institutions in Seoul, is committed to reduction efforts based on the recognition that there are ample ways to reduce carbon emissions [14]. Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) is contributing to the development of renewable energy technology by being the first power generation company to build and open 100,000 cases of renewable energy AI training data [15]. Furthermore, Changwon City is raising public awareness of carbon neutrality by exhibiting winning entries from the 'Carbon Neutrality, The Future We Draw' drawing contest [13].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Accelerated Climate Action and Policy Changes in the International Community",
        "content": "The international community is also accelerating actions and seeking policy changes to address the climate crisis. Various methods for developing countries to advance climate action through innovation and technology are being presented, emphasizing the importance of global cooperation [18, 20]. Regarding policy changes, Hawaii has begun implementing a tourism tax to combat climate change [19]. Australia's lead negotiator for COP31 has announced plans to lobby oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia for a phase-out of fossil fuels at the next UN climate summit, signaling international pressure [23]. Meanwhile, China is set to abolish export subsidies for solar products starting April 2024 and gradually reduce subsidies for battery products, which is expected to significantly impact the global renewable energy market [16]. Concurrently, universities in various countries are hosting lectures on climate change, raising public awareness and encouraging the participation of future generations [22].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "The domestic and international trends we have examined in today's briefing once again highlight the urgency of responding to climate change, as well as the importance of efforts from various stakeholders. Our sustained attention and action are required to overcome the climate crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
