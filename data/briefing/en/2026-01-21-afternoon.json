      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Companies and Local Governments: Climate Change Response Efforts and Innovation",
        "content": "Today, the climate change response efforts of domestic companies are drawing significant attention. ABB has demonstrated a leading role by simultaneously achieving an 'A' rating in both the climate change response and water security management categories of the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) [1, 2, 4]. Schaeffler also reaffirmed its global leadership by earning an 'A' rating in the CDP climate change category for the fourth consecutive year [6, 7, 9]. Concurrently, adaptation efforts are ongoing across various industries, with new plant variety protection applications for climate change response exceeding 14,000 cases [5, 8, 10, 14, 16], and Cheonan Nonghyup exploring climate change adaptation strategies through cucumber cultivation technology training [3]. Jeju National University's RISE Project Group successfully completed the Korea-Vietnam Climate Change Digital Breeding Education Program [12]. Furthermore, Jecheon City and Chuncheon City are proactively responding to climate change by launching new livestock businesses and transitioning their specialized wildfire prevention and suppression teams to year-round operation, respectively [11, 13].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Carbon Neutrality Policy Implementation and Deepening Debates",
        "content": "Domestically, various policies and projects for achieving carbon neutrality are being actively pursued, but critical voices regarding the policy direction are also growing. Chungnam Province is playing a leading role by introducing carbon neutrality concepts and expanding wood use in public construction projects worth 7 trillion won [19, 23, 30, 34]. Local governments such as Ansan Environmental Foundation, Gwangju Nam-gu, Yecheon, and Daegu City are also making tangible efforts towards carbon neutrality [20, 24, 25, 37]. The Korea Environment Corporation is also striving to enhance expertise by recruiting trainees for greenhouse gas management specialists [36, 38]. However, civil society has criticized the public discussion on amending the Carbon Neutrality Act, demanding a 'halt to hasty implementation' [17, 22, 96]. Particularly, intense debates are ongoing regarding the classification of air-source heat pumps as renewable energy, with criticisms such as 'reversal of carbon neutrality,' 'concerns about grid burden,' and 'greenwashing' warnings being raised [18, 27, 31, 41, 46, 58, 59, 60, 74].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚡ Accelerating Energy Transition and Discussions on Diverse Power Sources",
        "content": "Efforts to expand renewable energy are materializing across South Korea. Hwaseong City is accelerating energy independence by installing 104 new and renewable energy facilities, including solar and geothermal systems, in the Jeongnam-myeon area [40, 47, 50, 63, 84]. The Korea Social Responsibility Investment Forum proposed a 100 GW renewable energy roadmap to the Ministry of Climate by 2030 [61, 79, 80]. The global initiative RE100 also urged the Korean government to implement measures for expanding renewable energy, calling for policy efforts [68, 79]. Meanwhile, a public opinion poll revealed that 80-90% of the public agrees on the necessity of nuclear power generation and its expansion alongside renewable energy [55, 75, 94]. However, civic groups criticized this survey as 'tailored to package government policy,' suggesting the need for a more complex discussion on the energy mix [95].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🔴 Deepening Global Climate Crisis and Humanity's Response",
        "content": "Globally, the severity of the climate crisis is escalating, with its impacts manifesting widely. UN experts have warned that the world has reached a state of 'water bankruptcy' due to climate change, pollution, and overuse, stating that billions suffer from water scarcity [109, 129]. Ecosystem changes are being observed, such as Antarctic penguins starting their breeding season 13 days earlier than a decade ago [100, 112, 116]. While Environment and Climate Change Canada predicts 2026 will be a year of extreme heat [117], a complex phenomenon is also being reported where climate change exacerbates disasters, but the number of fatalities does not proportionally increase [98, 99, 107, 113, 115, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]. Furthermore, research indicating that half of global CO2 emissions originate from just 32 fossil fuel companies underscores the need for strong action against major polluters [127]. UK intelligence chiefs have also warned that biodiversity collapse threatens national security and exacerbates food security issues [128, 130].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As highlighted in today's briefing, climate change presents both complex challenges and opportunities across all sectors of our society. While efforts to address the climate crisis and transition to renewable energy continue both domestically and internationally, more decisive and consistent action is required to overcome the intensifying crisis. This concludes today's climate briefing."
