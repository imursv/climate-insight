      {
        "title": "🔴 Global Climate Crisis Warnings and Domestic Impacts",
        "content": "The news reported today once again reminds us of the severity of global climate change. In 2025, climate change already played a key role in some major weather phenomena [16], and the oceans are also sending continuous warnings [23]. Amidst this crisis, freshwater fish worldwide are facing extinction due to climate change [17], and a letter has been released stating that global warming threatens even holiday foods [24], indicating that its impact is deeply penetrating daily life. Domestically, a grim outlook suggests that if greenhouse gas emissions remain high, the Daegu region could experience heatwaves and tropical nights for as long as two months in 2050 [1], emphasizing the need for immediate action.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Adaptation and Carbon-Neutral City Planning",
        "content": "Domestic local governments are actively working to establish robust response systems in line with the ongoing climate crisis. Jeollanam-do Province is transforming its approach to 'adaptation policies' in response to the ongoing climate crisis [2]. This is a crucial step to acknowledge the reality of climate change and minimize its damages. Furthermore, local government policies must be closely linked to citizens' lives [3, 7], and the importance of carbon-neutral city planning is particularly emphasized [3, 7]. As discussions actively take place regarding the conditions sustainable cities must meet in the era of carbon neutrality [4, 8], efforts to build climate-resilient cities are expected to accelerate.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Expansion of Renewable Energy and Advancements in International Cooperation",
        "content": "Concrete actions and international cooperation efforts to address climate change are drawing attention. South Korea and Germany are exploring ways to expand renewable energy and integrate power grids [9, 10], thereby strengthening international collaboration. Domestically, innovative efforts are continuing in various sectors, such as the Korea National Railway Authority recruiting carbon-neutral ideas for the railway sector through its 'Green Rail Challenge' [5]. In the educational field, students from Mokpo Girls' Commercial High School are practicing carbon neutrality through an ecological experience at the Yeongsan River [6], leading the participation of future generations. Internationally, communities in Rochester and Geneva, USA, have received state government subsidies for climate change mitigation [18, 19], and Cuba's Ciego de Ávila region is playing a leading role in climate change response through initiatives like solar power plant construction and mangrove restoration [20, 25].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Policy Challenges and Efforts to Raise Climate Awareness",
        "content": "There is also news indicating that responding to climate change is a complex challenge requiring political and social consensus. The case where a federal appeals court temporarily halted a climate change tax on Hawaii cruise ship passengers [22] suggests the existence of legal and economic hurdles in implementing climate policies. Even amidst these challenges, efforts to raise public awareness and understanding are steadily continuing, such as the introduction of 10 short documentaries addressing climate change and social justice [21]. This will play a crucial role in securing broad social participation and support for resolving the climate crisis.",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis while also shedding light on various domestic and international efforts to address it. This is a time that calls for continuous attention and action. This concludes the climate briefing for January 3, 2026."
