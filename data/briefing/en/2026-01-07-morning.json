        "title": "🔴 Intensifying Climate Crisis Warnings and Visible Impacts",
        "content": "Recently, warnings about the severity of climate change have grown louder, directly impacting our daily lives and ecosystems. Domestically, a vicious cycle of forest fires due to climate change has been noted [1, 2], while internationally, reports indicate that 2025 is projected to be confirmed as the hottest year on record [39]. In fact, 2024 has already been recorded as the first year that was more than 1.5°C hotter than the 19th-century average, and fossil fuel consumption is expected to reach an all-time high in 2025, raising global concerns [74]. Furthermore, research suggests that microplastics are hindering oceanic carbon absorption, thereby exacerbating climate change [51], and reports continue to emerge that climate change is causing persistent intense heatwaves globally and threatening human rights [41, 43]. These phenomena clearly demonstrate how widely climate threats are spreading across our society, and predictions regarding climate change risks and challenges for 2026 are becoming a significant topic for the insurance industry as well [58].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Response Policies and Institutional Progress",
        "content": "Domestically, institutional reforms and concrete practical efforts to address the climate crisis are actively underway. The Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) has reorganized its structure, establishing a 'Climate Change Response Department' and expanding/creating related divisions to address the food climate crisis [3, 6]. Furthermore, the Presidential Committee on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth has relaunched as the 'National Climate Crisis Response Committee' starting in January, strengthening its role as the control tower for climate crisis response [8]. At the local government level, Suncheon City has begun full-scale support for open-field fruit farmers to cope with abnormal weather, securing a budget of 1 billion KRW for farmer support in 2026 [7, 10]. Yeoncheon County is also expanding cooperation with academia, having signed an agreement with Seoul National University for climate crisis response and carbon neutrality implementation [13, 16, 17]. Participation from various entities continues, with companies and local communities also contributing: Youngpoong has launched its 2050 carbon neutrality roadmap [11], Korea Western Power is developing a 'Carbon Neutral Campus' at Soonchunhyang University [15], and Cheonan City has commenced a training program for carbon neutrality citizen experts [19, 20].",

      {
        "title": "🌍 Diverse Climate Actions and Discussions in the International Community",
        "content": "The international community is also exploring diverse approaches and cooperation regarding climate change. South Korea and China have agreed to expand comprehensive ESG cooperation in climate change, circular economy, and nature conservation, emphasizing the importance of regional collaboration [4, 5]. The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics is setting an example for climate action in sports by emphasizing eco-friendly elements such as utilizing 95% existing venues and medals made from recycled waste [27]. Climate activist Luisa Neubauer delivered a positive message, stating her view that ecology should be joyful and liberating, not a punitive force [35]. Scientific and technological advancements are also being made, such as the development of an energy system optimization model for net-zero greenhouse gas emission pathways in Southeast Asia [71]. However, international discussions and differences in opinion on the direction of climate policy still persist, with figures like UK Science Secretary Kemi Badenoch expressing net-zero skepticism and proposing more oil drilling for economic growth [72].",

      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Ecological and Socio-economic Ripple Effects of Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change extends beyond mere temperature increases, exerting widespread ripple effects across ecosystems and socio-economic sectors. In the UK, winter flowers have been observed blooming earlier than usual due to climate change [34], and globally, ecological shifts such as birds moving to higher altitudes in mountains are being reported in various regions [37, 48, 52, 54, 55, 57, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]. These changes highlight the importance of climate in historical contexts, such as tracing climate change and migration records in medieval England through ancient tooth research [38]. Economically, there is growing interest in the impact of climate change on housing purchase costs [32]. In Canada, despite a slight drop in climate change as a priority, approximately 60% of the population demands strong action on wildfires [61], demonstrating that public awareness and policy demands regarding climate threats remain high. Warnings are also being raised about instances of using poor sources to deny the negative impacts of climate change, emphasizing the importance of accurate information [45].",
