      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Expansion of Domestic Climate Change R&D and Carbon Neutrality Policy Investment",
        "content": "The Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea is investing 151.1 billion KRW in climate change response research and development (R&D) this year, representing a 75% increase from the previous year [1, 3, 10, 17]. This investment will focus on developing core technologies, including the CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) mega-project, hydrogen energy, and climate adaptation [18, 25]. Furthermore, the Planning Office has initiated the establishment of a mid-to-long-term national development strategy, incorporating carbon neutrality as a key policy in the '2030+ National Development Roadmap' [33, 41, 46]. The largest-ever Climate Response Fund has also begun full-scale operation towards carbon neutrality [45, 52, 60], expected to accelerate the nation's transition to carbon neutrality [26, 53].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Climate Response Efforts and Achievements of Domestic Companies and Local Governments",
        "content": "Domestic companies are demonstrating notable efforts and achievements in responding to climate change. Fujifilm Holdings and global footwear manufacturer Changshin have proven their environmental leadership by achieving top or A ratings in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) climate change and water security categories [6, 7, 8, 13, 21, 22, 27]. Local governments are also showing proactive engagement: Miryang City is establishing apple orchards to adapt to climate change [2, 28], while Jeju City and Namwon City are each investing 130.9 billion KRW to fully commit to creating carbon-neutral cities and eco-healing environments [38, 42, 44, 50, 51]. The Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) is dedicated to climate change education through the publication of marine science books [4, 12, 23], and Gyeongnam Institute of Technology and Namseoul University are contributing to the spread of climate action by operating carbon neutrality expert training programs and idea challenges [36, 47, 48, 54, 55, 57].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Accelerated Renewable Energy Transition and Current Challenges",
        "content": "Domestically, vigorous efforts are underway for a major transition to renewable energy. President Lee Jae-myung declared a grand transition to AI and renewable energy, emphasizing the goal of achieving a 3% potential growth rate [72]. Jeollanam-do Province has also expressed its determination to leap from the periphery to the center by making AI and renewable energy the core pillars of regional development [63, 66, 74, 75]. Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) is leading technological innovation by becoming the first power generation company to build AI training data for wind and solar renewable energy [65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73]. Meanwhile, the new and renewable energy industry is also active, with LS Electric securing an ESS project in Japan and OTEC entering the data center market [76, 77, 79]. However, realistic challenges associated with the expansion of renewable energy are also being discussed. For instance, price issues have been highlighted as a major point of contention in discussions on the energy mix, including solar and nuclear power [78, 64].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Threats to International Climate Cooperation and the Reality of Extreme Weather",
        "content": "Significant threats to international climate cooperation have been detected. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for signing withdrawals from 66 international organizations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an act seen as declaring the collapse of an 80-year-old multilateral system [9, 11, 82, 95, 102]. This move raises concerns that it could severely impact global warming efforts [82]. Meanwhile, climate change is causing extreme weather phenomena worldwide. Abnormally high temperatures in early January in Missouri, USA, have been reported in connection with climate change [90], and a shift in North Pacific storm tracks towards the poles has also been observed [96, 97]. In response, the Delaware state government has announced updated plans for climate change response and community protection [84, 92, 99], and Montgomery County considers its new weather station a tool to enhance climate change resilience [87]. Thus, various communities continue their efforts to confront the reality of climate change [91, 93, 94].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing has highlighted the global expansion of investment in climate change response and the diverse efforts being made both domestically and internationally. However, it also contains warnings regarding threats to the international cooperation framework and the materialization of extreme weather phenomena. This concludes today's climate briefing."
