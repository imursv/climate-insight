    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerated Climate Action by Domestic Local Governments and Corporations",
        "content": "Domestically, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has been recognized for its top-tier climate crisis response capabilities, the only local government in Korea to receive an A grade for four consecutive years in the 'City Climate Crisis Response Assessment' [2, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24]. Gwangju Metropolitan City plans to invest 2 billion KRW to create 10 urban forests to combat heatwaves and the urban heat island effect [22, 23, 25, 26, 27], and Mungyeong City is also fully committed to climate change response by accelerating disaster prevention projects [5]. In the corporate sector, Gaon Group demonstrated its ESG capabilities by achieving an A grade in the CDP Climate Change Response Assessment [3], and Jeju Saekdal Landfill exceeded its greenhouse gas reduction target for 2025 [38, 39]. Various entities are thus continuing their efforts towards carbon neutrality [29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 106].",

      {
        "title": "🌍 South Korea Lays Groundwork to Lead Global Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "South Korea has been nominated to chair the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Assembly next year or in 2027, seizing a significant opportunity to lead global discussions on renewable energy [40, 44, 48, 49, 50, 53, 56, 60, 62, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 77, 81, 82, 85, 87, 91, 93, 94, 95, 99, 100, 103, 105]. Domestic public power generation companies are accelerating their transformation into renewable energy enterprises, alongside Korea Electric Power Corporation's (KEPCO) plan for early establishment of an 'Energy Highway' [41, 65, 79, 96], and POSCO Steelion is speeding up its 2050 decarbonization goal by installing solar power facilities at its sites, replacing 6% of its annual electricity with renewable energy [45, 84, 92, 101, 102]. Meanwhile, a positive international trend was reported last year, with coal power generation in China and India simultaneously decreasing for the first time in 50 years [58, 123, 125].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Concerns of Reversal in Climate Action and Policy Dilemmas",
        "content": "Domestically, controversy surrounding energy policy is intensifying, with growing industry opposition over whether air-source heat pumps should be designated as renewable energy [28, 46, 52, 72, 78, 83, 88]. The dilemma between 'speed' and 'space' in renewable energy expansion, along with the need for a region-centric approach, has also been raised [47, 51], and concerns have been expressed that the subordinate regulations of the Offshore Wind Special Act should not undermine public interest and environmental integrity [57, 89, 97]. Internationally, a warning was issued that the United States' pursuit of oil development in Venezuela could deplete 13% of the global carbon budget [10, 124], and in Europe, the perception of the climate crisis as 'someone else's problem' has deepened, with the EU's passive stance on climate finance also being criticized [1].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🔴 The Severe Reality and Widespread Impacts of Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change is no longer a theoretical threat but a present reality [114], with international reports indicating that destructive wildfires and intense thunderstorms are exacerbating losses for insurance companies [107]. In the United States, climate change is already impacting national income [116], and news has emerged that agriculture is severely disrupted by phenomena such as basement flooding [109] and abnormal occurrences where flowers bloom in autumn and freeze in spring [117]. Philippine fisheries production also faces challenges due to climate change [121], and its impacts are spreading across society, including anxiety about having children in an era of climate crisis [120].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "📰 Raising Climate Change Awareness and Research Trends",
        "content": "Efforts to raise social awareness of climate change are also continuing. In January, the film 'When the Wolves Come Out at Night' was screened at the 'Climate Change Cine Talk' event [6], and the Seoul Energy Dream Center and the Climate and Environment Network signed a climate response agreement, pledging joint efforts [7]. Internationally, scientific research is actively underway, with clues about climate change being revealed in marine sediments [118], and discussions and interest in climate change are increasing across various sectors, with civil organizations like the League of Women Voters of the Lagrange Area addressing climate change as a key agenda item [113, 30, 115, 122].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlights the coexistence of diverse domestic and international efforts and positive progress in addressing climate change, alongside policy dilemmas and warnings about the severe real-world impacts of climate change. This is a time when more proactive and integrated climate action is required for a sustainable future. This concludes the climate briefing for January 13, 2026."
