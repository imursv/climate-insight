        "title": "🔴 Deepening Climate Crisis and International Backsliding",
        "content": "Recently, the direct impacts of the climate crisis have been deepening both domestically and internationally, and the movement by some major countries to backtrack on their carbon neutrality goals is causing concern. Domestically, 'forest fire risk days' have tripled over the past 45 years [1], the spread of pine wilt disease due to climate change threatens the defense strategy for Geumgang pine trees, and agricultural sector damages are becoming a reality, such as heatwaves in coffee-producing regions hindering yields and quality [4, 8]. Internationally, the United States is showing serious cracks in international cooperation by pressuring the International Energy Agency (IEA) to withdraw if it does not abandon or modify its 'net-zero' targets, and by instructing it to exclude focus on climate change [5, 18, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 38, 40, 41, 50, 59, 76, 103]. Furthermore, extreme weather phenomena are being reported across the globe, including increased bacterial infections among beachgoers on the US East Coast, shortened ice fishing seasons due to thinning ice, high avalanche risks in California, and brutal heatwaves and wildfires in southeastern Australia [105, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]. This situation once again emphasizes the urgency of responding to the climate crisis and demonstrates the critical need to maintain international solidarity.",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Domestic Climate Change Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality Efforts",
        "content": "Various local governments and institutions in Korea are making diverse efforts to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change and transition to a carbon-neutral society. The Gwangyang Plum Blossom Festival has undergone a major operational shift to a 'sustainable model' in response to changes in blooming rates due to climate change [2, 9, 10, 12, 17]. Jangsu-gun is promoting a project to support facilities for reducing orchard damage, thereby enhancing climate resilience in the agricultural sector [3, 6, 7, 16]. Furthermore, Wonju-si is taking proactive measures for citizen safety, such as installing shade covers on playground equipment in children's parks in preparation for heatwaves [24]. Numerous local governments, including Gimcheon-si, Cheongsong-gun, Jung-gu of Incheon, Geoje-si, Namhae-gun, and Gwangju-si, are actively encouraging citizens to practice carbon reduction in their daily lives through the vehicle carbon neutrality point system [20, 25, 42, 49, 51, 52, 55, 57, 58, 64, 66, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75, 78, 79, 80, 82]. These efforts by local communities and the private sector form a crucial pillar of climate change response.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Next-Generation Energy Systems and Industrial Transition",
        "content": "To achieve energy transition, which is central to climate change response, investments in building next-generation distributed power grids and expanding renewable energy are accelerating. The government is investing 321 billion KRW into establishing a carbon-neutral customized 'next-generation distributed power grid,' which will serve as a crucial foundation for expanding renewable energy [15, 29, 46, 54, 56, 70, 77, 92]. Boseong-gun is actively pursuing renewable energy generation projects through its 'Sunshine Income Village Project,' aiming to create income for residents [86, 90, 98]. Yangpyeong-gun and Gochang-gun are also promoting integrated renewable energy support projects to enhance regional energy self-sufficiency [85, 87, 89, 93, 94, 95, 97]. Furthermore, major domestic companies are actively participating in the energy transition, with Samsung C&T planning large-scale investments in SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) and renewable energy [91], and Hanwha Ocean expanding its renewable energy business, focusing on offshore wind power [96, 99, 100, 101]. The record-low cost of battery storage demonstrates the potential for the combination of solar power and Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to reshape the energy market.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Carbon Neutrality Technology Development and Talent Nurturing",
        "content": "Efforts are also accelerating in technology development and nurturing specialized talent to achieve carbon neutrality goals. The Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) has begun recruiting key talent to lead in AX, AI, and carbon neutrality fields [30, 31, 32, 34, 39, 43, 45, 60, 63]. The Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) has also announced its commitment to leading AI, carbon neutrality, and safety-focused railway R&D innovation [35]. Korea Gas Corporation and Changwon Fatima Hospital are pioneering greenhouse gas reduction cooperation in the medical sector, presenting a new carbon neutrality model [53, 61]. Hankuk Aviation University's RISE Project Group is exploring carbon neutrality implementation strategies with local communities [62], and Korea Southern Power (KOSPO) is actively investing in future generations by sponsoring 150 million KRW for carbon neutrality talent development in cooperation with the Busan National Science Museum [83]. These efforts will be key drivers in accelerating the transition to a carbon-neutral society.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Diverse Aspects of International Climate Change Response",
        "content": "In the international community, diverse discussions and attempts regarding climate change awareness and response methods are ongoing. Questions have been raised in some quarters about the rationality of climate change response funding [104], and an analysis has suggested that climate change could lead to 'insurance deserts' in the insurance market [110]. Ecosystem changes have also been observed, with research indicating that Atlantic bluefin tuna are migrating northward in search of more favorable ecosystems due to climate change [106]. Meanwhile, Tuvalu presents a hopeful case by exploring a transition to a digital nation in response to climate change [113]. Corporate sector climate change response consulting capabilities are also strengthening, with EY being recognized as a leader in the Verdantix Climate Change Green Quadrant report [109]. Furthermore, grassroots interest continues, as evidenced by reader submissions supporting local community efforts in climate change response [108].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "Today's briefing highlighted the severity of the climate crisis along with diverse response efforts both domestically and internationally. Climate change is no longer a problem of the future but a present threat, and international cooperation and sustained domestic efforts are becoming increasingly crucial. This concludes today's climate briefing."
