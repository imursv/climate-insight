        "title": "🔴 Intensifying Climate Crisis: Warning Signals on the Korean Peninsula and Worldwide",
        "content": "According to the Korea Meteorological Administration's analysis released today, over the past 113 years, the Korean Peninsula has experienced a 2.2-fold increase in heatwave days and a 4.2-fold increase in tropical night days. Summers have lengthened by 25 days, and winters have shortened by 22 days, indicating an acceleration of climate change [3, 9, 11]. The Jeju region is experiencing 'boiling' conditions [2], and 2025 has been warned as facing 'the limits of adaptation' due to extreme climate phenomena such as heatwaves, storms, heavy rainfall, wildfires, and droughts [14]. Internationally, alongside the WWA report's warning that climate change is causing extreme weather events beyond adaptation limits [67], the reality of the climate crisis is becoming clearer in various parts of the world, with orange-colored water appearing in the Arctic due to global warming [68] and national park wetlands flooding due to sea-level rise [75]. Furthermore, there were reports that impoverished communities faced significant difficulties in 2025 due to climate change and disasters [73].",

      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Transitioning Climate Crisis Response System: Strengthening Policies and Institutions",
        "content": "The government is strengthening its policy and institutional framework for responding to the climate crisis. The 'Presidential Committee on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth' will be renamed the 'National Climate Crisis Response Committee' starting January 1st next year, serving as a pan-national control tower encompassing climate disasters [5, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 49, 50]. Concurrently, the 'Revised Korean Green Taxonomy,' focusing on greenhouse gas reduction and climate adaptation, will be applied from January 1st next year. Renewable energy categories will be further subdivided into solar, wind, and other sources, expanding to 100 items including heat pumps [4, 10, 61]. Climate Minister Kim Sung-hwan stated that the combination of renewable energy and nuclear power generation is inevitable, suggesting a realistic approach to energy transition [53]. Furthermore, local governments, such as Gyeonggi Province, are also making institutional efforts to address the climate crisis, with the revised guidelines for establishing city/county master plans for carbon-neutral city transition coming into effect from the new year [28, 31].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic and International Efforts and Achievements Towards Carbon Neutrality",
        "content": "Various efforts and achievements towards realizing carbon neutrality are continuing both domestically and internationally. Jeollanam-do Province has secured 643.9 billion KRW in national funding for environmental projects, accelerating the establishment of carbon-neutral infrastructure [30, 32, 37, 47]. Gwangju Metropolitan City has released a 'Carbon Neutrality White Paper' detailing its greenhouse gas reduction achievements to the public [29]. The environmental industry in the Busan region has shown significant growth over the past five years [23], and Seongnam City has introduced hydrogen electric buses, officially promoting carbon-neutral public administration [34]. In Yecheon County, the 'Carbon Neutral Village Creation' pilot project was successfully completed [26, 52], and Seoul City reformed its 'Eco-Mileage System' to encourage citizen participation [39]. Internationally, a new bill to address climate change is scheduled to be enacted in 2026 [71], and cooperation and action are expanding, with the UoH UNESCO Chair joining a global network to tackle climate change [74].",

      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Renewable Energy Transition: Progress and Challenges",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy is accelerating. Notably, Taean Thermal Power Unit 1 ceased operations today, which the government has evaluated as the starting point for a renewable energy-centric transition [60]. Korea East-West Power is conducting training to strengthen expertise and operational capabilities in solar power projects [55, 62, 64], and Kumyang Green Power is accelerating its growth, focusing on wind power generation [54]. Furthermore, the Daewol 2 Industrial Complex in Icheon City is set to transition to renewable energy by establishing a public-led RE100 model [56]. Soonchunhyang University, in collaboration with Korea Western Power, is creating a carbon-neutral, eco-friendly campus through the installation of campus solar power and the construction of a smart grid [40, 42, 44, 46, 58, 63, 65]. However, concerns have also been raised regarding the discrepancy between the pledge to triple renewable energy expansion and actual targets and reality [59], underscoring the need for continued attention and effort.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ New Threats and International Warnings",
        "content": "A warning has been issued about a new crisis, 'digital climate change,' which is related to climate change but has not yet been sufficiently discussed [72]. Furthermore, in 2025, the UK experienced a record number of grassland, forest, and crop fires, with 10 fire departments suppressing nearly 27,000 wildfires [77], and a large-scale fire in Palisades added to the severity [76]. This suggests that even if climate change is not the direct cause of these fires, environmental factors such as dry climate can play a complex role. Meanwhile, the news that Indian Oil Corporation made its first purchase of Colombian crude oil under the Ecobetrol contract [78] indicates a continued reliance on fossil fuels, reflecting the complex reality of the global energy transition.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, the climate crisis is intensifying, and its impacts are being felt globally. Simultaneously, governments, local communities, and industries worldwide are establishing institutional foundations and making tangible efforts to address this crisis. We anticipate that these efforts will lead to more robust and effective actions in the new year of 2026. This concludes today's climate briefing."
