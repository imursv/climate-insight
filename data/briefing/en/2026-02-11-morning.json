        "title": "🔴 Concerns Over International Climate Policy Rollback: Changes in U.S. Trump Administration's Climate Policy",
        "content": "In today's international news, serious concerns have been raised regarding the U.S. Trump administration's stance on climate change policy. White House officials stated that President Trump plans to 'dismantle' or 'significantly weaken' U.S. climate change policies and environmental regulations [34, 50]. Specifically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to withdraw its own conclusion that greenhouse gases warm the planet and threaten health, revoke its landmark finding that climate change endangers the public, and halt related funding [30, 38, 46]. These actions are interpreted as an attempt to abolish the scientific basis underpinning U.S. climate change policy and to withdraw the climate change finding that is central to automobile regulations [29, 32, 35, 39]. Furthermore, under pressure from the Republican Party, federal agencies are reportedly removing the climate change chapter from official manuals for U.S. judges, threatening even the process of scientific evidence-based policymaking [33, 36]. Critics warn that these anti-environmental policies will lead to more pollution and higher energy costs [64].",

      {
        "title": "⚠️ Domestic and International Climate Change Phenomena and Warnings",
        "content": "The direct impacts of climate change are being detected in various locations, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the need to readjust Arbor Day due to rising temperatures caused by climate change has been mentioned [4], and extreme drought experiences have been reported in Gangneung [5]. Internationally, the global freshwater crisis is intensifying due to pollution, overuse, and climate change [57], and research has also indicated an overheating phenomenon in the Atlantic Ocean [61]. Furthermore, analyses suggest that climate change makes the process of choosing a suitable home more difficult and is linked to child abuse [31, 45], raising concerns about complex impacts across society. In some parts of the UK, unusual weather patterns continue, with persistent wet weather including 40 consecutive days of rain this year [65]. Meanwhile, in China, a surge in renewable energy coexists with a record high in proposed coal-fired power plants, revealing a dual energy structure that heightens awareness regarding climate response [18].",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Domestic Carbon Neutrality and Climate Response Efforts",
        "content": "Amidst these challenges, various efforts are continuing domestically to achieve carbon neutrality. The necessity of introducing direct payments for climate change response has been raised [1], and the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has decided to implement carbon neutrality in all schools [11]. The Yangsan City Facilities Management Corporation is practicing carbon neutrality through the resource circulation of waste electronic products [12], and Jeongeup City is encouraging citizen participation by launching a campaign to reduce single-use items during the Lunar New Year holiday [15]. At the corporate level, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) has solidified its position as a carbon neutrality leader, being selected as the 'Most Respected Company' for two consecutive years [13], and Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) is accelerating the carbon-neutral transition of small and medium-sized enterprises through 'ESG precision diagnostics' and financial support [14]. The Korea SMEs and Startups Agency (KOSME) is also recruiting companies to participate in its carbon neutrality facility investment support project, aiding the eco-friendly transition across industries [16].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Trends in Renewable Energy Transition",
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy is steadily progressing both domestically and internationally. Kim Jae-jun, former Chunchugwan Director of the Blue House, stated that the Saemangeum renewable energy vision prepared during the Moon Jae-in administration is now entering its fruition stage [17]. An agreement has been signed for the Saemangeum Floating Solar Power Project Phase 1, targeting commercial operation by December 2029 [27]. Wanju County is also building a regional renewable energy foundation by promoting 'Sunlight Pension Villages' [19], and Gimhae City aims to achieve 40% energy self-sufficiency by directly operating solar power facilities on idle land [26]. Gwangju City is creating a virtuous cycle by generating 'hidden profits' through the sale of solar certificates and reinvesting them into energy welfare projects [24, 25]. Domestically, voices for policy support are strong, with Assemblyman Kim Sung-hwan urging the introduction of a regionally differentiated electricity tariff system and the expansion of renewable energy generation to 100 GW [28]. Internationally, the UK is investing 1.7 trillion KRW in local renewable energy projects [20], and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) has successfully secured $500 million in project financing for a renewable energy power project in Guam, USA [21]. Furthermore, with more solar power plant constructions planned following record-breaking renewable energy auctions [63], the expansion of renewable energy is establishing itself as a global trend.",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Broad Discussions and Research on Climate Change",
        "content": "Climate change is being discussed not merely as an environmental issue but across various fields such as society, economy, and science. A survey revealing that Czechs and Slovaks perceive climate change but remain skeptical about political action demonstrates the gap between public awareness and policy implementation [40]. The existence of differences in government support for private sector climate change adaptation between developing and developed countries suggests issues of international cooperation and equity [41]. Discussions are ongoing regarding the links between climate change, geophysical hazards, and sports [42, 43], and scientific research indicates climate change signals appearing in CMIP6 extreme indices [44]. Furthermore, questions are being raised about how schools should respond to climate change [37], and the Freeport Public Library is hosting a climate change lecture series [47], highlighting the importance of education and information sharing on climate change. Explorers are delving into ancient Antarctic ice to study climate change, aiding in the understanding of long-term climate shifts [62]. The first sighting of a European robin in Montreal, Canada, during a harsh winter illustrates even the subtle impacts of climate change on ecosystems [66].",

    ],
    "closing": "As we have reviewed in today's briefing, climate change is a global challenge, and we have once again confirmed the importance of proactive responses at national and community levels, as well as efforts towards renewable energy transition, even amidst uncertainties in international policy. This concludes today's climate briefing."
