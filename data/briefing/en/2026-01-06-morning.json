    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "🇰🇷 Strengthening Domestic Climate Change Response Systems and Corporate Responsibility",
        "content": "To ensure food security and stable supply of agricultural products, the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) has established a 'Climate Change Response Department' and upgraded existing divisions, thereby building a control tower for climate crisis response [1, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14]. Furthermore, the Jeonnam Agricultural Research and Extension Services is exploring innovative agricultural technologies for climate change response, and Anseong City is fully committed to strengthening farmers' capabilities through practical training for new year farmers, demonstrating active regional climate adaptation efforts [4, 16]. In the corporate sector, NH Investment & Securities achieved the highest rating, 'Leadership A,' in the CDP climate change response assessment, while Doosan and Doosan Fuel Cell also attained a 'B' rating, recognizing their climate response efforts in the financial and industrial sectors [5, 10, 12, 17, 58]. Concurrently, South Korea and China have regularized their industry ministers' meetings and expanded scientific, technological, and digital cooperation, signing 14 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) for joint climate change response, thus solidifying the foundation for international cooperation [3, 7, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌱 Accelerating Carbon Neutrality Transition and Energy Innovation",
        "content": "Domestically, corporate efforts to achieve carbon neutrality goals are accelerating. Kumho Petrochemical Group is pursuing its 2050 carbon neutrality goal through CCUS and enhanced resource circulation, while Korea South-East Power (KOEN) has declared 'Namdong Energy New Road 2040,' simultaneously pursuing carbon neutrality and global advancement [27, 28]. Local governments are also demonstrating initiatives for carbon neutrality; Seongnam City Council held a strategic discussion on carbon neutrality, and Seongbuk-gu is recruiting trainees for its 2026 Carbon Neutrality Action Group Guide training program [23, 24, 31]. In the renewable energy sector, power generation methods utilizing the sea and fields are being discussed in Jeonnam [33], and Gyeonggi Province is implementing region-specific strategies, such as aiming for a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through the realization of 'Gyeonggi RE100' [36]. Notably, in the electric vehicle sector, domestic researchers have made significant progress in the transition to eco-friendly mobility by developing high-capacity electrode technology that increases battery output by 75%, addressing the challenge of extending driving range [38].",
        "tone": "positive"
      },
      {
        "title": "⚠️ Deepening Climate Crisis and Increased Vulnerability",
        "content": "Amidst the growing recognition that the climate crisis has become 'normalized' [15], its severity is manifesting across various sectors worldwide. Domestically, the Yeongdong region, considered a frontline for climate change, faces numerous environmental challenges [2], and the expansion of renewable energy has been hampered for over a year and a half, raising concerns about the pace of energy transition [34]. Internationally, tropical forest trees are observed to be fighting against climate change but losing the battle [42], and even Venice's famous crab dishes are facing survival threats due to climate change [47]. Furthermore, the necessity for climate change preparedness in Florida's water infrastructure is being emphasized, and rising sea levels are threatening food security in southern Iran [49, 59], indicating that the physical impacts of climate change are directly affecting social infrastructure and human survival. Despite these circumstances, criticism has been raised that climate change physics continues to be ignored in public planning [51], further highlighting the importance of policy formulation based on scientific evidence.",
        "tone": "urgent"
      },
      {
        "title": "🌍 Global Climate Action and Challenges",
        "content": "Global climate action continues to present a complex picture. At the recent COP30, mixed results emerged, and while BRICS nations showed leading momentum in climate action [40], strong criticism erupted from some quarters, stating it's time to end leaders' 'empty rhetoric' on climate change response [50]. Furthermore, the observation that COP presidencies tend to focus more on international politics than on climate policy [55] raises questions about the fundamental objectives of international climate negotiations. An interesting study revealed that politicians in the UK and Belgium significantly underestimate public support for green policies such as solar subsidies or meat taxes [68], suggesting a perception gap between policymakers and citizens. Amidst this, the UK Parliament's Environmental and Climate Change Committee has launched a youth engagement program for 2025-26, demonstrating a positive move to encourage future generations' participation in climate action [61].",
        "tone": "neutral"
      }
    ],
    "closing": "As of January 5, 2026, institutional reforms and technological innovations to address the climate crisis continue both domestically and internationally, while the direct impacts of climate change are intensifying, and policy challenges are becoming clearer. We must confront the reality of the climate crisis and build a better future through continuous cooperation and action based on scientific foundations. This concludes today's climate briefing."
